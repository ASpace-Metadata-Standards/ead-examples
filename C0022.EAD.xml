         <abstract>The collection consists primarily of a set of handcolored, topographical, manuscript maps (111 of them), created by Louis-Alexandre Berthier, an officer on General Rochambeau's staff, depicting the historic overland march of the
            French and American forces from Philipsburg, New York, to Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781 and their return march to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1782. Accompanying these maps is Berthier’s journal (in French), providing a detailed description
            and explanation of the routes covered by the maps. In addition, there are documents and memoranda concerning French military events in America, Berthier’s departure from France in 1780, and his return to France via the West Indies in
            1782-1783.</abstract>

      <bioghist>
         <p>Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753-1815), one of the four sons of Jean-Baptiste Berthier, was born in Versailles, where his father was in charge of the Royal Map Service. He entered the army as a young man; in 1777, at the age of twenty-four,
            he attained the rank of captain. In 1780 he asked to be assigned to Rochambeau's army which was preparing to leave for America, and was offered a place on the staff of Count de Saint-Maisme who commanded the Soissonais regiment. Through a
            series of mishaps and misunderstandings (related in the journal in the Princeton Library), Berthier did not leave with Rochambeau's army when it sailed from Brest in May 1780, but proceeded to America via the West Indies and finally
            joined up with the army at Newport, Rhode Island, on September 30, 1780.</p>
         <p>In January 1781, Captain Berthier was assigned to the staff of General Rochambeau, as "aide maréchal général des logis surnuméraire." In this capacity he accompanied the army in 1781 on its march to Yorktown, and in 1782 on its return
            march to Boston, and thence to the West Indies, before returning to France. In all, Berthier was in the United States from September 30, 1780, until December 24, 1782.</p>
         <p>After his return to France, Berthier was sent on a military mission to Prussia in 1783. (The Journal of this mission is among the manuscripts at Princeton.) He continued to be employed in staff posts, and to earn regular promotions. When
            the French Revolution came he again saw active service in the field. In 1796 he accompanied General Bonaparte in the Italian campaign, as chief of staff of the army. Henceforth, his fortunes were linked to those of Bonaparte. Berthier
            participated in the coup d'état of the 18th Brumaire (1799) which established the Consulate, and received the post of Minister of War. Soon after Bonaparte became Emperor Napolean I, in 1804, he chose Berthier as one of the eighteen army
            officers to be named Marshal of the Empire. Subsequently, Berthier acquired other titles: Duke of Valangin, Price of Neufchâtel, Prince of Wagram. Marshal Berthier was with Napolean in the campaigns of Austerlitz, Jena, and Friedland; he
            was in the Peninsular Campaign (1808), the Austrian Campaign (1809), in Russia (1812), Germany (1813), and France (1814). In 1814 he abandoned Napoleon, and died the following year, on June 1, 1815, at Bamberg.</p>

         <scopecontent>
            <p>Berthier's maps, numbering 111, are the most notable feature of the collection. They do not comprise an atlas or a series of separate items, but, rather, they are the consecutive record of that important and historic Revolutionary War
               military event, the overland march of the French Army under Rochambeau (joined by American forces at Philipsburg) from Newport to Yorktown during the summer and early autumn of 1781, and the return march of the French Army from
               Virginia to Boston the following year, July - December 1782. These were executed, presumably soon after the event, from information and sketches made on the spot while Berthier was accompanying Rochambeau's Army in America. The maps
               fall into two interrelated series: the first showing the French Army's camp sites on the southward march from Newport, Rhode Island, to Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, and on the return march northward in the summer and autumn of 1782;
               the second showing the "itineraries" or daily marches of the Army (from Newport as far as Elkton, Maryland, in 1781; the daily marches for the 1782 northward journey are lacking among the Princeton papers.) Another set of Berthier's
               maps is preserved among the Rochambeau Papers in the Library of Congress; this set, although duplicating in part the Princeton set, is apparently less complete</p>
            <p>Although Berthier's maps are the most spectacular part of these papers at Princeton, they cannot be fully appreciated without the accompanying textual material of his journal (1780-1783), which provides a detailed description and
               explanation of the routes covered by the maps. In addition, there are related manuscripts and documents, including a letter (1785) from Rochambeau, notes on the history of Virginia, and Berthier's journal of his later visit to Prussia
               (1783).</p>

               <p>This series consists of maps, memoranda, and documents regarding French military events in America during months of 1781.</p>
            </scopecontent>
            <arrangement>
               <p>The documents and maps are arranged chronologically by packet/item number that continue (for the most part) the numbering begun in the previous series.</p>
            </arrangement>
            <bibliography>
               <p>Descriptions for the maps have been taken verbatim from Howard C. Rice and Anne S. K. Brown, <emph render="italic">The American Campaigns of Rochambeau's Army</emph> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1972), Volume 2.
                  Leading numbers in the map titles correspond to numbers assigned to the maps by Rice and Brown; these numbers are used in their descriptions to refer to other Berthier maps. (The actual Princeton/Berthier number for the map is
                  provided at the end of each description.) Gaps in the Rice-Brown numbers reflect the fact that they also draw from other sources in their work (i.e., also describe other maps). Measurements, in centimeters, give the size of the
                  sheets.</p>

                  <p>Figuration of the Route and of the Different Camps Occupied by the French Army from Providence to the Junction of the Two Armies at the Philipsburg Camp. This heading appears on the cover of the first of a series of "cahiers"
                     containing the road maps of the army's march. Each sheet includes the route for one day's march, usually covered on four successive days by the four divisions. The point of departure is at the left, the destination at the right.
                     The campsites are shown in more detail in another series of the maps, below, Nos. 26ff. . . . The "Itineraries," above, give a detailed description of the route and should be read as commentary on the road maps; further
                     identification of localities is given in the notes to the "Itineraries."</p>

                        (I I) on the crest of the hill, above the letter "D" of Hartford, designated the gallows on the Gallows Hill. See Itinerary 2 n. 26, where this "justice" is mentioned. "West Division" is the older term for West Hartford, which
                        was set up as a separate town only in 1854.</p>

                     <p>Seventh Day's March: from Farmington to Barne's Tavern. 26-29 June 1781. The cluster of houses designated here as "Formington. Village" is within the boundaries of the present town of Plainville (incorporated in 1869).
                        "Soudington" is Southington. "Baron's Taverne," where the army camped, was Barnes' Tavern, in present Marion in the town of Southington, Connecticut, on what was later named French Hill. The "Chn. de meridon," beyond Barne's
                        Tavern, is the Meriden Road.</p>

                     <p>Ninth Day's March: from Break Neck to Newtown. 28-30 June - 1 July 1781. The four divisions arrived successively at the Newtown camp on 28, 29, 30, June, and 1 July 1781. The first three each halted here an extra day, but the
                        fourth (including the Saintonge Regiment) made no extra day's halt. From here on the army marched by brigades of two divisions each. The First Brigade (including the Bourbonnais and Deux-Ponts regiments) left Newtown during
                        the night of 30 June-1 July; the Second Brigade (including the Soissonnais and Saintonge regiments) left on 2 July. "Woodbury" here designates, not the present town of Woodbury, which is farther north, but a part of Southbury,
                        which was separately incorporated from Woodbury only in 1787. The "Rivière de Stratford" is now called the Housatonic; the crossing shown here is near the site of the present Shepaug Dam.</p>

                        5 miles north of the village of Ridgefield proper. The map shows the camp by brigades, with a detachment of grenadiers and chasseurs in an advanced position. "Miry Broung" is Miry Brook.</p>

                     <p>Eleventh Day's March: from Ridgebury [in Connecticut] to North Castle [in New York]. \ 3 July 1781. While the French were camped at Ridgebury, orders were received for a change of itinerary. Instead of proceeding westward from
                        Ridgebury to join the Americans at Peekskill on the Hudson, as originally planned, the French army now veered to the southwest to join their allies at Philipsburg. The First Brigade, leaving Ridgebury on 2 July, bivouacked at
                        Bedford (present Bedford Village) and proceeded next day to the camp at North Castle (present Mount Kisco, Westchester County, New York). The Second Brigade covered the whole distance from Ridgebury to North Castle, by a
                        slightly different route, in a single day's march on 3 July 1781. This road map shows only the route of the Second Brigade. The "Pond" indicated midway along the route is Lake Waccabuc. The bridge over the Cross River is now
                        inundated by the Cross River Reservoir. The "justice," noted along the route between Cross River and North Castle, indicates a gallows, commemorated in the present name of Hangman's Hill.</p>

                     <p>20-25 August 1781. New Castle to Stony Point and West Point - with details of the 18 batteries and redoubts around West Point, and a drawing below showing A) Profile of the wooden redouts constructed at West Point ["Profil des
                        redoutes en bois construites à West-point."] and B) Profile of an entrance to Fort Clinton where a countersink was relieved and the entrance was closed ["Profil d'une embrazure du Fort Clinton dont les fraizes se relèvent et
                        ferment l'embrazure."]</p>
                     <p>Leaving the Philipsburg camp on 18-19 August 1781, the French army proceeded northward in two columns to Pines Bridge on the Croton River and thence in a single column to King's Ferry, while the American army marched via New
                        Bridge at the mouth of the Croton over a route closer to the Hudson. There is no new map for the first march from Philipsburg to North Castle (Mount Kisco), but No. 25, showing the southward march on 6 July, indicates the
                        route over which the right column of the French army retraced its steps in the opposite direction some six weeks later.</p>
                     <p>The map reproduced here represents the second, third, and fourth marches extending over the period 20-25 August. The portion at far left traces the road over Crow Hill from North Castle (not shown) to Pines Bridge on the
                        Croton River. "New-castl," used in the inscription, designated the general area and is now the name of the township of Newcastle, established in 1791. Between the Croton River and "Crompton" (present town of Yorktown) is the
                        Hunt's Tavern camp (shown on the map, but not so designated); cf. No. 61. The next encampment at Verplank's Point near the eastern end of King's Ferry, also shown here, is depicted in greater detail in the series of camp maps,
                        No. 62. Finally, across the Hudson, beyond the Stony Point peninsula, is the so-called Haverstraw camp (present village of Stony Point), also depicted in the campsite maps, No. 63.</p>
                     <p>This map is extended to include The Highlands and a plan of West Point, though the army's route did not pass through the area north of Peekskill. General Rochambeau and several of his officers, accompanied by Washington,
                        visited the key American stronghold on 23 August.</p>

                     <p>March from Haverstraw to Suffern. 25-26 August 1781.This was the first march after the crossing of the Hudson at King's Ferry, made on successive days by the First Brigade (including the Bourbonnais and Deux-Ponts regiments)
                        and Second Brigade (including the Soissonnais and Saintonge). The route led from the Haverstraw camp (i.e., Stony Point village) via Kakiat (present New Hempstead, Rockland County, New York) to Suffern, New York. Kakiat
                        ("meeting house," "Coff taverne," "Keycit place" on map) was a pivotal point on the eighteenth-century routes leading from the Hudson into northern New Jersey: the "lower road," indicated here, went south along the Saddle
                        River to Paramus and the Jersey lowlands, while the upper road taken by the French army went via Suffern into the Ramapo Valley, which was protected by mountains on the east. Suffern was likewise an important road junction:
                        the road from New Windsor, north of West Point and The Highlands, via The Clove, came in here.</p>
                     <p>In preparation for the march through New Jersey, Jeremiah Wadsworth and John Carter (Church), purchasing agents for the French army, instructed their agent, David Reynolds, to assemble supplies (15 tons of hay, 20 tons of
                        straw, 230 bushels of corn, 5 cords of wood) at each of the following "staging posts": Suffern, Pompton, Whippany, Bullion's Tavern, Somerset Courthouse, and Princeton.</p>

                     <p>March from Suffern [in New York] to Pompton [in New Jersey]. 26-27 August 1781. The route along the Ramapo Valley corresponds closely to present U.S. Route 202. "Pompton," the terminus of this march, is the locality now known
                        as Pompton Plains. The curious words "her scaller house," designating a property between Pond's Church and the Pompton River, is a draftsman's miscopying of "Mr. [Casparus] Schuyler's House." "Bartoli moulin" is probably
                        Bartolf's (or Bertolf's) Mill; "Fanallen's Mills," Van Allen's.</p>

                     <p>March from Pompton to Whippany: 27-29 August 1781. The First Brigade halted here an extra day, not leaving until the 29th; the whole army was thus camped at Whippany on the 28th. The upper branches of the Passaic River are
                        sketched here in pencil; "fork," under the word "Whippany" in the heading, indicates present Two Bridges, at the confluence of the Pompton and Passaic river. "Ferme de Mr. Lot," to the left of Troy Town on the map, is
                        Beverwyck, the estate of Lucas von Beverhoudt, then also the residence of Abraham Lott, a patriot refugee from New York City. See Itinerary 3, p. 57 and n. 36.</p>

                     <p>March from Whippany to Bullion's Tavern. 29-30 August 1781. "Hanover's Vll. [Village]" at the left of the map is the locality to the west of Whippany now known as Monroe; Whippany, an ancient settlement never incorporated
                        separately, is still part of Hanover Township. The "Mill" shown here forms the present boundary between Morris and Somerset counties. The "Maison du lord Sterling" was the estate of WIlliam Alexander ("Lord Stirling"),
                        southeast of Basking RIdge, near the site of the present Somerset Hills Airport. Bullion's (or Bolan's) Tavern was at present Liberty Corner. It was at this point in the march that the troops began to realize that they would
                        not be attacking the British in New York via Staten Island but that Virginia was their destination.</p>

                        present Martinsville. The descent over First Watchung Mountain down into the Raritan Valley was via Steele's Gap, as described above in Itinerary 4. "Vinvington house" is the Van Veghton house, near Van Veghtan's Bridge (the
                        present bridge at Manville, State Route 553). Somerset Courthouse is present Millstone on the river of that name; the county seat was later moved to Somerville.</p>

                     <p>March from Somerset Courthouse to Princeton. 31 August - 1 September 1781. The "Mill" at left of map, then belonging to Archibald Mercer, is the locality subsequently known as Blackwell's Mills. The route crossed to the east
                        bank of the Millstone River at Griggstown (not named here) where several taverns are shown. The Delaware and Raritan Canal now runs parallel to this part of the Millstone. The army's route recrossed to the west side of the
                        river at Rocky Hill (not named on map) and thence to Princeton via Mount Lucas Road, the last strech of which is now called Witherspoon Street. The property shown across the road (present Stockton Street) from the army's
                        campsite is "Morven," then the residence of Annis Boudinot, widow of Richard Stockton, "The Signer," who had died earlier that year.</p>
                     <p>Describing the army's march from Princeton to Somerset Courthouse a year later (8 September 1782), Von Closen notes (p. 235): "We did not take the same road as the previous year, but a new passage was opened up along the

                     <p>March from Princeton to Trenton. 1-2 September 1781. The route follows closely present U.S. Route 206. "Stony brug Hameau," at left of map, indicates the "hamlet" at Stony Brook (Worth's Mill), one of the earliest settlements
                        (ca. 1700) in what later became the town of Princeton. "Maidenhead" is present Lawrenceville, so renamed in honor of Captain James Lawrence, naval hero of the War of 1812. At Trenton two ferries are shown below the falls:
                        Trenton Ferry, which crossed the Delaware from the foot of Ferry Street near the present Pennsylvania Railroad bridge, and Continental Ferry, lower down, which crossed from a point below the present site of Riverview Cemetery

                     <p>March from Trenton to Red Lion Tavern. 2-3 September 1781. The army had now reached Pennsylvania. The river to the right of Bristol on the map is the Neshaminy. As indicated in Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal (p. 45), the
                        artillery crossed it at a ford, several miles upstream, while the infantry used the ferry. Dr. James Thatcher, who was marching with the American army at the same time, notes in his <emph render="italic">Military
                           Journal</emph> {Boston, 1823), p. 325, that on 1 September "we crossed a small river at Shammany's rope ferry. Our boats were pulled across with facility by a rope made fast at each shore." Red Lion Tavern, the terminus of
                        this march, was on present U.S. Route 13, at Poquessing Creek, which now forms the northern boundary of the City (and County) of Philadelphia.</p>

                     <p>March from Red Lion Tavern to Philadelphia. 3-4 September 1781. There was an extra day's halt in Philadelphia, the First Brigade departing on the 5th, the Second on the 6th. The "ancienne ligne Angloise," shown on the map
                        beyond Kensington and to the north of the then-populated part of Philadelphia, extended from the mouth of Conoquonoque Creek on the Delaware (a bit to the north of the present Benjamin Franklin Bridge) westward to the height
                        of land above the Schuyllkill now occupied by the Philadelphia Museum of Art; this line of fortifications, built by the British during their occupancy of the city in 1777-1778, ran approximately between present Callowhill and
                        Spring Garden Streets. The map shows, upper right, the river forts: Billingsport and Red Bank (Fort Mercer) of the New Jersey shore of the Delaware, and Fort Miffin (of Mud Island) on the Pennsylvania side. General Rochambeau
                        sailed down the river to Chester in order to inspect these forts; cf. Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, n. 83. The "Maison à Mr. le Ch[evali]er de la Luzern," shown on the map below the Falls of Schuyllkill, lower right, was
                        "Laurel Hill" (also known as the Randolph Mansion), a country house rented by the Chevalier de la Luzerne, the French minister; it still stands on the bluff overlooking the Schuylkill in East Fairmount Park, between "Ormiston"
                        and "Strawberry Mansion."</p>

                     <p>March from Philadelphia to Chester. 5-6 September 1781. The river, far left of map, is the Schuyllkill, with the pontoon bridge shown on the previous map. The route from Philadelphia, via Darby, to Checter is described in
                        Itinerary 5. It was at Chester that Washington greeted Rochambeau (who had come down the Delaware from Philadelphia by boat) with the joyful news that de Grasse's fleet had arrived in the Chesapeake Bay; cf.

                     <p>March from Chester [in Pennsylvania] to Wilmington and to Newport [in Delaware]. 6-7 September 1781. After Marcus Hook the route crossed Naaman Creek, several smaller streams, then the Brandywine, before entering Wilmington.
                        As clearly shown here, Wilmington was originally built facing Christina Creek, according to a pattern similar to that of Philadelphia, with its Front Street along the Christina corresponding to Philadelphia's Front Street
                        along the Delaware. The map indicates that one brigade (the Second) camped beyond Wilmington at Newport. The following year, when bound north, the army camped only at Newport (the four divisions in succession, 29 August-1
                        September 1782), and marched through Wilmington without halting there to camp; see No. 135.</p>

                     <p>March from Newport [in Delaware] to Head of Elk [in Maryland]. 7-8 September 1781. The route follows closely the "Old Baltimore Pike" (which has now been eclipsed in importance by U.S. Route 40 to the south of it and
                        Interstate 95 to the north). Proceeding from the left of the map, "Whytly Crick" is White Clay Creek, "Christine Bridge" is now called Christiana, and "Couche's Bridge" is Cooch's Bridge, near which there stands today an
                        eighteenth-century house still owned by the Cooch family. A monument by the bridge commemorates the "Battle of Cooch's Bridge," i.e., the skirmish of 3 September 1777 between Washington's troops and the British, led by
                        Cornwallis, who had landed at Head of Elk and were proceeding towards the Brandywine and Philadelphia. Beyond Cooch's Bridge the route goes over Iron Hill, the height of land between the Delaware and the upper reaches of
                        Chesapeake Bay. It was expected that the army would embark at Head of Elk.</p>
                     <p>This is the last in the series of detailed road maps depicting the army's marches. Two blank leaves that follow it and that precede the last map in the "cahier" (the plan of Baltimore, No. 81) suggest that Berthier intended to
                        continue and complete the series.</p>

                     <p>Roadstead and Harbor at Baltimore. This map, included in the series of road maps for the 1781 marches (see note on No. 60), shows a larger area than map No. 80. It is extended eastward to include Whetstone Point and its
                        fortifications (now Fort McHenry National Monument) and Gorsuch's Point opposite. In addition to the army units shown on No. 80, this one indicates four other regiments, lower right. Although the identifying colors have not
                        been completed, these probably represent American regiments under General Lincoln.</p>
                     <p>Other maps of Baltimore drawn the following year when the French army halted here from 24 July to 24 August 1782, are Nos. 129 to 130. The rapid growth of Baltimore during the decades following the Revolution may be traced by
                        comparing Berthier's maps with the engraved map by A. P. Folie ("French Geographer"), "Plan of the Town of Baltimore and Its Environs" (1792), and with Warner and Hanna's engraved "Plan of the City and Environs of Baltimore"
                        (1801).</p>

                     <p>Ford across the Elkridge River (near Baltimore). After leaving Baltimore and proceeding towards Spurrier's Tavern the army crossed the "Elkridge," i.e., the main branch of the Patapsco River, forming the boundary between
                        Baltimore and Howard Counties. The ford, above the town then known as Elk Ridge Landing, is described in the note included on the map: "The detour that must be taken to cross by the ford is not great and I estimate the
                        difference as about three-fourths of a mile, or a mile. The road leading to the ford is bad and filled with stones and foot-high stumps. As it approaches the ford the road is dangerous along the bank of the river, which is
                        very deep in those places where the waters are damned up to operate the forges. This ford is very good if you pass between the big stones as marked here; if you stray from this line, you find large rocks and holes." ("Le
                        détour quil faut faire pour passer au gué est tres peu de choses et j'estime la differénce a 3/4 de Mille ou 1 mille. Le chemin du gué est mauvais et rempli de Rochers et d'Arbres coupés a un pied de terre. En arrivant au gué
                        il est dangereux suivant l'Escarpement de la Riviere qui est très profonde dans les Endroits ou les Eaux sont retenües pour faire aller les forges. - Ce gué est fort bon en cotoyant les grosses pierres cy marquées; lors qu'on
                        s'en Ecarte on trouve de Grosses Roches et des Troüs.") The inscription, upper left, indicates that the little road up over the bluff ("la montagne") is "passable only for troops on foot."</p>
                     <p>There is no map for the 35th camp at Spurrier's Tavern (16 September 1781), but see below, No. 128, which shows the camp made there on 23-26 August 1782 when the army was returning northward from Virginia.</p>

                     <p>Ford at Falmouth across the Rappahannock River. July 1782. According to Clermont-Crèvecœur (p. 73), the artillery used this ford, which was particularly bad. The infantry and the wagons, however, were ferried across; cf.
                        Verger's journal, p. 159, and Von Closen, p. 210. The road at lower left, an alternate route from Fredericksburg to the ferry, is described here as "a very bad path, but shortening the distance over the main road by more than
                        half."</p>

                  <p>Plans of the Different Camps occupied by the Army under the Orders of the Comte de Rochambeau: Campaign of 1781. This is the cover of a "cahier" containing maps of the army's camps from Rhode Island to Virginia. The key indicates
                     that artillery units are tinted in pink, French troops yellow, and American troops green. Light-green tinted areas marked "b" show "bois," i.e., woods; blue designates water. Note also that the yellow-tinted symbols for French
                     regiments, when enclosed in a dotted line, indicate positions occupied in 1782 (on the northward return march from Virginia to New England) by the Royal Deux-Ponts and Saintonge regiments, then marching together as a brigade.
                     Since some of these maps thus combine information concerning the 1781 and 1782 campaigns, it is evident that the finished copies were not completed until after 1782, perhaps after Berthier's return to France.</p>

                  <p>For a single surviving example of the rough field sketches made on the spot, see No. 150. These maps of the 1781 camps are from the Berthier Collection, Princeton University Library, formerly in the Château de Grosbois. A second
                     set, now in the Library of Paul Mellon, was once among Rochambeau's papers in the Chateau de Rochambeau. A few minor variations, such as the omission of certain names, seem to signify that the General's set was copied from
                     Berthier's own set. Still another series of these camp plans, somewhat similar to the Berthier set but much smaller in size, are included in a manuscript entitled "Précis des Opérations et des Marches de l'Armée combinée
                     française et américaine pendant la Campagne de 1781" in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California (MS HM 621); see "Checklist of Journals," <emph render="italic">s.v.</emph> Soisonnais Regiment.</p>

                     <p>Second Camp at Waterman's Tavern. 18-21 June 1781. Fifteen miles from the preceding camp at Providence. The dates on the maps of the camps, here and subsequently, are those of the arrival of the First Division. Since the army
                        was marching in four divisions, each camp was occupied on at least four successive days. The maps are so oriented that the direction of the march is at the top of the sheet. The incoming and outgoing roads are generally
                        designated by the point of departure of the day's march and by the next day's destination: in this instance, the Providence road and the Plainfield road. Waterman's Tavern is in the town of Coventry, Rhode Island. The "chemin
                        de Providence" is now Matteson Road. The tavern itself is on Maple Valley Road. The "meeting-house" is no longer standing; State of Rhode Island Historic Cemetery, Coventry 37, is near the site. The stream on the left is
                        Turkey Meadow Brook.</p>
                     <p>The army camped again on this site, by brigades, in November 1782, as indicated here by the units enclosed in dotted lines.</p>

                     <p>Sixth Camp at East Hartford. 22-28 June 1781. Twelve and a half miles from the preceding camp at Bolton Center. Each of the four infantry regiments halted here for two extra days. The positions shown nearest to the Connecticut
                        River indicate the camp of the Bourbonnais on the right (22-23-24 June, replaced by the Saintonge, 25-26-27 June) and the Royal Deux-Ponts on the left (23-24-25 June). The position along the road from Bolton, in the lower part
                        of the map, is that of the Soissonnais (24-25-26 June). Since the Saintonge departed only on 28 June, the East Hartford camp was occupied continuously from the 22nd to the 28th. The stream at the lower part of the map is the
                        Hockanum River.</p>

                        includes the northern part of the street). The brook at the bottom of the map, flowing under the road and into the larger stream at the right (Pequabuck), is Diamond Glen Brook. The camp ("a mile from Farmington," according to
                        Itinerary 2, above) was on the west side of the main road (present Route 10) just beyond its junction with Scott Swamp Road (present Route 6).</p>

                        local historian, the Reverend Herman R. Timlow, in his <emph render="italic">Sketches of Southington, Conn</emph>. (Hartford, 1875) notes that in June 1781 "the French army, under the command of Count de Rochambeau passed
                        through the town," and adds: "Marshall[!] Berthier was aid to the Count."</p>
                     <p>The position shown within dotted lines denotes the second of two regiments that camped here together on 26-27 October 1782, when the army was marching by brigades.</p>

                        Bronson's Tavern (here shown left of letter "B") is on present Artillery Road. The portion of the road passing through the encampment (artillery on left side) is now abandoned; only the right-hand swing of the loop remains. As

                     <p>Thirteenth Camp at North Castle [Mount Kisco, New York]. 3-6 July 1781. The First Brigade, which left the Ridgebury camp on 2 July and bivouaked that night at Bedford, and the Second Brigade, which marched the whole distance
                        from Ridgebury on 3 July, both reached North Castle on 3 July. As mentioned in the heading of the map, no plan of the Bedford (Village) bivouac of the First Brigade was drawn. North Castle is present Mount Kisco, Westchester
                        County, New York. The "Etang" or pond, formerly known as Kirby Pond, no longer exists; the area is part of present Leonard Recreation Park. The stream flowing out of the pond is the Kisco River. The North Castle "meeting
                        house," shown here, was St. George's Church (built in 1761); it no longer stands, but an old cemetery still marks the site.</p>
                     <p>A French hospital was maintained at North Castle during the period of the long encampment farther south at Philipsburg. There was a bivouac here at North Castle, 20 August 1781, when the army was proceeding north from
                        Philipsburg to King's Ferry; see notes to Nos. 48 and 61.</p>

                     <p>Sixteenth Camp at Hunt's Tavern. 21 August 1781. This was the second camp after Philipsburg. There is no map of the previous day's bivouac at North Castle (Mount Kisco). Hunt's Tavern was situated in present Yorktown,
                        Westchester County, New York, on what is now designated as State Route 35 (U.S. 202) near the corner of Hallock's Mill Road, opposite Baldwin Road. The two ponds (<emph render="italic">étangs</emph>) shown on the map are
                        Mohansic Lake and Crom Pond. The roads at the left of the sheet lead westward to New Bridge at the mouth of the Croton River. The four divisions with field artillery units are shown, as well as detachments of grenadiers and
                        chasseurs, and Lauzun's Legion, the latter serving here as a rear guard facing the enemy to the southward.</p>
                     <p>The French army camped here again in the autumn of 1782 when returning from Virginia to New England. See Nos. 145 and 146, the map of its so-called Crompond encampment, where it remained from 17 September to 20 October
                        1782.</p>

                     <p>Seventeenth Camp at King's Ferry or Verplanck. 22-24 August 1781. Fourteen miles from the preceding camp at Hunt's Tavern. The crossing of the Hudson at King's Ferry is described in Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal (p. 40) and in
                        Berthier's journal (p. 255). Berthier, who supervised the crossing of the wagons, notes that the last vehicle had crossed the river by midnight on 25 August. The road to New Bridge, at the left of the map, is the route by
                        which the Americans reached King's Ferry. The fort shown here is above the letters "nk" of "Verplank" is Fort LaFayette, of the east bank of the Hudson.</p>

                     <p>Eighteenth Camp at Haverstraw. 24-25 August 1781. Two miles from King's Ferry. The army was now marching by brigades of two divisions each. The date on the map is that of the arrival of the First Brigade. The "Haverstraw"
                        camp, the first after the crossing of the Hudson (and the eighteenth since the departure from Providence, Rhode Island) was in the locality now known as Stony Point Village (as distinguished from the Point proper). The
                        designation "Haverstraw" is correct, since the name applied in 1781 to a larger area than the present town of Haverstraw, which is farther south. The larger of the two streams shown here is Cedar Pond Brook, flowing eastward
                        into the Hudson.</p>
                     <p>In September 1782 one brigade camped again on this site; see No. 142.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-First Camp at Whippany. 27-29 August 1781. Fifteen miles from the preceding camp at Pompton Plains. The First Brigade halted here a second day, so that the entire army was in camp here on the 28th. Both brigades are
                        shown. The map also indicates, by means of dotted lines, positions occupied when the army camped here again, northward bound, on 10-11 September 1782. The camp was located on grounds now occupied by the Bell Telephone
                        Laboratories, the Seeing Eye, and some adjacent houses on the high ground between Whippany Road (the main east-west road on the map, i.e., the road from Whippany to Morristown) and the northwest edge of the Black (or Columbia)
                        Meadows. The top of the map is approximately south. Roads leading off the left edge of the map went eastward to Chatham, the sightly position where Rochambeau had decoy bake ovens built to make the British believe an attack on
                        New York was imminent. Washington, who led the American army through New Jersey by a route paralleling the French to the east, had his headquarters temporarily at Chatham. The road leading off the right of the map went to
                        Morristown (and eventually to Bullion's Tavern, the destination of the next march). "Hanover" was, and is, the name of the township of which Whippany is a part.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-Second Camp at Bullion's Tavern [Liberty Corner]. 29-30 August 1781. Sixteen miles from the preceding camp at Whippany. Bullion's Tavern was at the locality later called Liberty Corner, in Pernards Township, Somerset
                        County, New Jersey. The spelling "Bullion" (probably a corruption of Boylan) also appears on American maps of the period. The stream shown on the map is Harrison's Brook, a tributary of Dead River, which in turn joins the
                        Passaic. The sharp right-angle turn in the road still provides an unmistakable point of referende for identification of the site of the French camp. The road at top of map, left, was the route leading eventually to Quibbletown

                     <p>Twenty-third Camp at Somerset Courthouse [Millstone]. 30-31 August 1781. Thirteen miles from the preceding camp at Bullion's Tavern. Somerset Courthouse is now called Millstone. The stream, which flows north into the Raritan,
                        is the Millstone River. The courthouse, near the second of the three bridges shown here, had been burned in October 1779 by British raiders under Lieutenant Colonel Simcoe. The road through the village taken by the army is
                        essentially present State Route 533, which has been straightened to eliminate the bow leading down to the bridge. The two infantry regiments and artillery camped near the Dutch Reformed Church (present edifice [1827] and
                        adjacent cemetery on same site) at the junction of present State Routes 533 and 514. Beyond the encampment, at a bend in the road, is the Van Doren house, still standing on this site. </p>
                     <p>The separate unit, on right of the map, represents Lauzun's Legion. Rumors of a British sortie from New York reached the army here at Somerset Courthouse. Fearing an attack, the Baron de Viomenil (who was then in command,
                        Rochambeau having ridden ahead) ordered patrols to the eastward. Lauzun ([2], p. 293) relates that he himself with 50 of his husars rode 10 miles out along the New Brunswick road: "I met two or three sizeable patrols of light
                        troops, who retired after exchanging a few shots with my hussars. I satisfied myself that the English army was not on the march, and then returned to reassure the Baron."</p>
                     <p>The army camped again at Millstone on its return march in 1782; see No. 138.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-fourth Camp at Princeton. 31 August - 1 September 1781. Fourteen miles from the preceding camp at Somerset Courthouse. The "Collège" is Nassau Hall. The road leading in from the right of the map—here called the road
                        from Somerset Courthouse, since that was the starting point of the day's March—is present Witherspoon Street. The army camped across the main road (Stockton Street, present U.S. Route 206) from the Richard Stockton residence
                        (Morven), indicated here with its private entrance road (dotted lines). The camp extended across Mercer Street (which did not exist in 1781) on to grounds now occupied by the Princeton Theological Seminary. The crossroads at
                        the lower part of the map is the present intersection of Nassau and Harrison Streets (Queenstown, Jugtown). The stream at the left of the map is Stony Brook, now enlarged at this point to form a part of Carnegie Lake.</p>
                     <p>The army camped again in Princeton, 7-8 September 1782, presumably on this same site, since no new map was drawn for the series representing the 1782 camps.</p>

                        cavalry, or hussars), which had marched with the First Brigade after the Hudson crossing at King's Ferry, is shown on the right-hand side of the road. The widest of the streets shown (on a line with the second "i" in
                        "Philadelphie" and the second "a" in "Delawar") is Market Street. The pontoon bridge across the Schuylkill was near the site of the present Market Street bridge.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-eighth Camp at Chester [in Pennsylvania]. 5-6 September 1781. Sixteen miles from Philadelphia. The street pattern shown here is still readily discernable in the heart of the modern city of Chester. The army's route from
                        Philadelphia came in via present Market (formerly High) street. The first intersection shown corresponds to present Sixth Street, after which come Fifth, Fourth, the Market Square. The old market in the center of the
                        intersection is represented on the map. Here the route turned sharp right along present Third Street and over the bridge across Chester Creek. The camp was southwest of the town on high ground along the road to Wilmington; the
                        site is well inside the present city.</p>
                     <p>A year later, when marching in the opposite direction, the army camped again at Chester, by divisions, on 30 August-2 September 1782. The camp was then northeast of the town, on the road to Philadelphia, between Ridley and

                     <p>Twenty-ninth Camp at Wilmington [in Delaware]. 6 September 1781. Eleven and a half miles from the preceding camp at Chester. As shown on the road map above, No. 59, the Second Brigade did not camp in Wilmington but marched
                        through and beyond the city to Newport, where it camped on 7 September. The route of the march through Wilmington and the campsite of the First Brigade there can be precisely determined by reference to the church and
                        surrounding burial ground (small crosses) shown on the map. This is the Friends' Meeting House situated in the block bounded by West, Fifth, Fourth, and Pasture (present Washington) Streets; the original building was replaced
                        by the present structure in the early nineteenth century. Thus the street at the top of the grid is Front Street, the one at right angles to it, far left, is Orange Street. The "Corderie," lower right, is a rope walk then on
                        he property of Mordecai Woodward. A small dotted line shows the army's route: coming into town via a road passing from the Brandywine Creek up over the height now crowned by the Du Pont and Nemours buildings, the army veered
                        into West Street, marching as far as Fifth, thence right into Pasture Street, down which it marched towards Front. The camp of the First Brigade was on a line with Second Street, in an area, then open fields, now included
                        between Justison and Adams Streets. The camp faced Front Street (and its extension, the Lancaster Pike) and was close to the road leading to Newport and Head of Elk (present Maryland Avenue), over which the troops would resume
                        their march the next day.</p>

                     <p>Thirtieth Camp at Head of Elk [in Maryland]. 7-8 September 1781. Twenty miles from the preceding camp at Wilmington. The First Brigade halted an extra day, so that both brigades were camped here together on the 8th, to the
                        morth of the main road leading through the village of Head of Elk, or Elkton. Elk Landing, a mile or so south of the village, was on the "Head of Elk River" (formed by the confluence of Big Elk and Little Elk creeks) at one of
                        the northernmost tips of the Chesapeake Bay to the Delaware River was largely eliminated by the completion in 1829 of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal a few miles south.</p>
                     <p>It was hoped that the armies, both French and American, could embark at Head of Elk and be ferried down the Bay to Virginia. In spite of Washington's efforts to have sufficient transport vessels assembled here. only a limited
                        number of troops could be accomodated. These included a French detachment commanded by Colonel Custine; cf. Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, nn. 89-90. These units are shown on the map close to the landing (within and below the
                        letter "H" of "Head of Elk").</p>
                     <p>The main part of the army thus continued its route towards Baltimore (and eventually Annapolis). The series of detailed road maps depicting the daily marches does not continue beyond Head of Elk, but the routes are
                        schematically indicated on the comprehensive map of camps and marches, No. 162.</p>
                     <p>The French army camped again at Elkton, by divisions, on 28-31 August 1782; see No. 134.</p>

                     <p>Bivouac at Lower Ferry. 9 September 1781. Fifteen miles from the preceding camp at Head of Elk. After being ferried across the Susquehanna the four infantry regiments, as shown here, bivouacked together along the northern edge
                        of the Baltimore road. "Lower Ferry" corresponds to the present Perryville-Havre de Grace crossing. ("Upper Ferry" was near Port Deposit.) The town of Havre de Grace did not exist in 1781, though when the French army passed
                        over this route again in 1782 (No. 133) several officers noted in their journals that such a town was then being planned; see Verger's journal, n. 134. The "Tavern" shown on the map is presumably the "Ferry House" (later the
                        Lafayette Hotel).</p>
                     <p>No artillery units are shown on this map. The wagons and artillery, escorted by Lauzun's hussars under Colonel d'Arrot (the Duc de Lauzun himself and his Legion's infantry had embarked at Head of Elk), took a more circuitous
                        route via Bald Friar Ford, which was some 7 miles upstream (above present Conowingo Dam). They camped at Cummings Tavern (Battle Swamp) east of the Susquehanna and, after the crossing by Bald Friar Ford, at "Dear Church" (Deer
                        Creek Friends Meeting, Darlington) to the west of the river. Their route, via Churchville, then merged into that of the infantry at Bush. Clermont-Crèvecœur made this detour with the artillery, as described in his journal (p.
                        53 and nn. 92-93).</p>

                     <p>Bivouac at Bush Town, or Harford. 10 September 1781. Twelve miles from Lower Ferry. Bush, originally called Harford Town, was the county seat of Harford County until 1783, when the seat was moved to Bel Air. Bush is still a
                        small hamlet very similar in its general pattern to the one shown on this map. It is on the "old Philadelphia road," present State Route 7, which has now been superseded as the main traffic artery by parallel highways to the
                        east (U.S. 40) and west (Interstate 95) of it. The stream flowing eastward (left of map), beyond which the infantry regiments bivouacked, is Bynum Run, a tributary of Bush River, which in turn flows into the Chesapeake Bay.
                        The road coming into the main road from the right of the map (below letter "B" of "Bush Town") is the route (present Calvary Road) over which the artillery and wagons arrived from Bald Friar Ford. As recorded in
                        Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal (p. 53), they reached Bush on 10 September, joining up the next day with the infantry regiments at a point beyond White Marsh.</p>
                     <p>The following year the army camped again at Bush, by divisions, on 25-28 August 1782, in a slightly differnt position. Cf. No. 132.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-third Camp at White Marsh. 11 September 1781. Two brigades, including the artillery, are shown. The distances noted in the headings of this and the following map indicate that this so-called White Marsh camp was 15
                        miles from Bush and 10 miles from the next camp in Baltimore. This would place the camp some 3 miles southwest of White March Forges (where the army camped on its northbound march in 1782, as shown on map, No. 131). The site
                        was probably along the old Philadelphia road (State Route 7) near the corner of present Mohrs Lane. The stream shown on the map is a branch of White Marsh Run. The building across the road from the camp may be the mansion
                        house of White Marsh Plantation, headquarters of the Nottingham Company, which managed the iron works at White Marsh Forges—or perhaps a tavern. Clermont-Crèvecœur (p. 54) places the camp at a "Tavern," which he does not
                        identify by name.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-fourth Camp at Baltimore. 12-15 September 1781. The street pattern shown on the map still underlies the section of modern Baltimore adjacent to the Basin, of "Port," as it is designated here. North is at the right of
                        the map, west at the top. Charles Street runs along the west side of the "Port"; above it (running diagonally) is Liberty Street. The street running west to east through the middle of the grid is Market (now Baltimore) Street.
                        The stream flowing from the north into the Basin is Jones's Falls; below it is Old Town, next is a depression known as the Harford Run, then a street (Point Lane, now Broadway) leading out to Fell's Point (not named on the
                        map).</p>
                     <p>One brigade (the Soissonnais and Saintonge, with artillery) is shown to the left (south) of the "chemin de Spurier's Tavern," i.e., the road (approximately U.S. Route 1) leading to Georgetown; on a height to the right (north)
                        of this road are more artillery and wagons, as well as two other units (including Lauzun's hussars, indicated by the cartographer's customary symbol for cavalry). Another brigade (the Bourbonnais and Duex-Ponts, with
                        artillery) was camped in Old Town, east of Jones's Falls, in readiness for embarkation.</p>
                     <p>The expected embarkation did not take place at Baltimore. Again, as at Head of Elk, transports proved inadequate; cf. Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, n. 98, and also Matthew Ridley's letter to Governor Lee, 9 September 1781,
                        conveying Washington's urgent request "for collecting Vessels from all parts" at Baltimore. Thereupon the army, now under the command of the Baron de Viomenil (Rochambeau having proceeded ahead with Washington overland to
                        Williamsburg), resumed its march on 16 September, bound for Georgetown and Alexandria on the Potomac. Upon reaching the next camp at Spurrier's Tavern, news of the arrival of La Villebrune's squadron at Annapolis determined a
                        countermarch back to the shores of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-Eighth Camp at Archer's Hope. 25 September 1781. The transports that had brought the combined French and American forces from Annapolis are shown off the landing point at Archer's Hope, which was about 7 miles southeast
                        of Williamsburg to the west of the mouth of College Creek. Washington (<emph render="italic">Diaries</emph>, II, 261) refers to the spot as "the upper point of College Creek." The present Colonial Parkway passes along this
                        shore. Archer's Hope is east of Jamestown Island, where Saint-Simon's forces from the West Indies had landed on 2 September. About 3 1/2 miles downstream and east of Archer's Hope encampment, depicted here near the shore along
                        the road leading to Williamsburg, shows both French regiments (yellow) and the American units (green).</p>

                     <p>Thirty-ninth Camp at Williamsburg. The road from Archer's Hope over which the army marched to its positions "at the gates of Williamsburg" is at the lower center of the map (below the word "Rich-mill's"). Clermont-Crèvecœur's
                        journal (p. 56) notes that the field artillery was brought up College Creek in boats and unloaded at College Landing (lower right of map). The new arrivals found Saint Simon's regiments already encamped to the northwest of the
                        town (lower left, tinted yellow) and Lafayette's Americans (tinted green) west and south of the College of William and Mary. The French detachment that had been brought from Newport in Barras's squadron was also in camp (cf.
                        Verger's journal, p. 137), as was the vanguard under Custine that had enbarked at Head of Elk. Rochambeau's regiments (tinted yellow) made their camp to the east of town behind the Capitol, while Washington's Americans (tinted
                        green) took a position farther to the south. The encampment at Williamsburg marked the 39th camp of Rochambeau's army since its departure from its 1st camp at Providence, Rhode Island, on 18 June. This map is the last in the
                        "cahier" of the 1781 camps. [The 40th and final camp of this "campaign," showing the siege of Yorktown, referred to at the bottom of the sheet, is reproduced in the Rice/Brown volume but is not part of the Berthier Papers at
                        Princeton.]</p>

                  <p>Plan of Hampton [in Virginia] to be Used for Establishing the Winter Quarters of Lauzun's Legion. 1 November 1781. The stream at the right, flowing south, is the Hampton River. The other directional arrow, at the left of the map
                     below the legend, is misleading (probably a mistake); the point indicates south, not the customary north. Directly below this arrow point indicates south, not the customary north. Directly below this arrow point is St. John's
                     Episcopal Chruch. The two longest streets forming a cross are King Street (from top to bottom of map) and Queen Street (left to right). The numbers indicating available lodgings were presumably used for assigning quarters. The
                     billeting list that might supply a key to these numbers is not preserved with the map and has not been found.</p>
                  <p>When steps were being taken to quarter his army early in November 1781, Rochabeau assured the local authorities that a barrack master approved by Governor Nelson and by General Washington would proceed in such a way as to cause
                     minimum expense to the inhabitants and that necessary repairs to war-damaged houses would be made at the King's expense; cf. his letter to the Council of the City of Williansburg, printed in Doniol, V, 584-585. According to Von
                     Closen (p. 162), the winter quarters, into which the troops moved on 15-18 November, were assigned as follows: the Bourbonnais Regiment, seven companies of the Royal Deux-Ponts, part of the Auxonne artillery, as well as the
                     General Staff, were quartered in Williamsburg. Three companies of the Royal Deux-Ponts were sent to Jamestown. The Soissonnais, with the grenadiers and chasseurs of the Saintonge, were at Yorktown (see No. 99). The Saintonge
                     Regiment encamped at Halfway House (on the road from Yorktown to Hampton) and Back River. A detachment of 50 men and an artillery company was assigned to Gloucester. The rest of the artillery went to West Point at the head of
                     York River (see No. 104). Finally, Lauzun's Legion took up quarters in Hampton, as confirmed by the present map.</p>
                  <p>The Lauzun Legion did not remain here at Hampton during the entire period of the "winter quarters." In early February 1782 Rochambeau sent the Legion under the command of General Choisy (Lauzun having returned temporarily to
                     France) to an advanced position near the North Carolina border at the request of General Nathanael Greene, who feard the arrival of British reinforcements at Charleston. The Legion remained in the vicinity of Charlotte Courthouse
                     until June, when it retired to Petersburg and eventually rejoined the main body of the army on its northward march. After the Legion's departure from Hampton a battalion of the Saintonge Regiment moved into quarters there.</p>
                  <p>During the French "occupation" of Hampton the courthouse (serving Elizabeth City County) was used as a hospital. This is the unnumbered building shown on the map a bit to the left of King Street directly below the second "u" of
                     "Lauzun" in the title. An Act of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia (5 January 1782) empowered the lustices of the peace in the said county as they may think proper, so long as the court-house in the town of
                     Hampton shall be occupied by the troops of our allies, as a hospital." The names of several French soldiers who died in Hampton (including Carette, Thouvenot, and Bourdet of the Saintonge Regiment) are mentioned in Bouvet, <emph render="italic">Service de santé</emph>, p. 94, and in Dawson, <emph render="italic">Français Morts aux Etats-Unis</emph>, pp. 60, 64, 65, 92.</p>

                  <p>Plan of Yorktown to be Used for Establishing the Winter Quarters of the Soissonnais Regiment, and of the Grenadiers and Chasseurs of the Saintonge Regimen. 12 November 1781. This map provides a record of Yorktown buildings as
                     they existed immediately after the siege. At the upper left (colored darker than the others) is "Secretary Nelson's" house, where Cornwallis has his headquarters at the opening of the siege and which later suffered heavily from
                     allied artillery bombardment. The building set back slightly from the south side of the main street (below the word "hyver" in the heading) was another Nelson house belonging to Secretary Nelson's nephew, Thomas Nelson, Jr.,
                     governor of Virginia and commander of the merican militia during the siege. Both Nelson houses figure in the annals of the siege; see, e.g., Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, n. 137.</p>

                  <p>The Thomas Nelson, Jr., house ("York Hall"), still standing, can be distinguished in the distant view of Yorktown included in Van Blarenberghe's paintings (Nos. 92 and 95). See also the "View of York," which was drawn at about
                     the same time as this ground plan and which is similarly oriented, with the York River in the foreground. Other buildings surviving today (the Customs House, Grace Church, etc.) may be identified by reference to the map of "Old

                  <p>Chain of Expresses between New Kent Courthouse, New Castle, and Lynch's Tavern, 1781. Early in November, a few weeks after the capitulation of Yorktown, Washington's Continentals left Virginia and returned northward to winter
                     quarters on the Hudson. The French army thus remained in an "intermediary position," as Rochambeau described it, between the Northern army and the Southern army in the Carolinas under the command of General Greene. In
                     instructions to Colonel Timothy Pickering, dated Williamsburg, 4 November 1781, Washington had noted: "For the purpose of Communicating Intelligence, I have agreed with Count Rochambeau who remains here to establish a Chain of
                     Expresses from hence to Philadelphia. You will take Measures to furnish your part of the Chain, which is to extend from the Bowling Green to Philadelphia; from the Bowling Green to this place [Williamsburg], extending towards
                     Genl Greene, will be continued by Count Rochambeau." <emph render="italic">Writings of GW</emph>, XXIII, 331.</p>
                  <p>The diagram and related memoranda prepared by L.-A. Berthier (a good example of the kind of assignments he received as an assistant quarter-master-general) show the "part of the chain" maintained by the French. Instructions for
                     the two hussars stationed at New Kent Courthouse, dated 9 November, specify that they will remain there night and day ready to relay dispatches between Williamsburg and Richmond or to the next post as New Castle; the tavernkeeper
                     at New Kent [James Warren] will feed the men and supply forage for their horses ("2 gallons of oats and 17 bunches of cornstalks per day"). Agreements also recorded here by Berthier mention that the tavernkeeper at New Kent is to
                     be paid 50 dollars a month, those at New Castle and at Lynch's Tavern 40 dollars.</p>
                  <p>Berthier was already familiar with this country, having traversed it when marching southward with the wagon train only a few weeks earlier; see Itinerary 6. New Castle, on the Pamunkey River, once a flourishing town, is now
                     extinct. Lynch's Tavern (also known as "Head Lynch's Ordinary," from the name of the tavernkeeper, James Head Lynch) was near Reedy Creek about halfway between the Pamunkey and Mattaponi rivers along the road corresponding to
                     present U.S. Route 301.</p>
                  <p>It evidently took the Americans some time to establish satisfactory service beyond Bowling Green to Philadelphia. Rochambeau, for example, complained to Governor Benjamin Harrison of Virginia that a month after Washington's
                     departure from Virginia he had not received a single letter from him. In a letter addressed to Beville, French quartermast-general, 5 December 1781, Richard Young reported from Fredericksburg: "If money cannot be obtain'd for the
                     purpose of paying the Express Riders at the different posts [between Lynch's Tavern and Fredericksburg] it will be impossible to keep up a line of Communication. . .." Manuscript Collections of Colonial Williamsburg,
                     Miscellaneous Manuscripts. Writing from Philadelphia, 8 January 1782, Washington avowed to Rochambeau: "I am fearful that the Expresses between this place and Williamsburg are badly regulated, and I shall upon the reutrn of the
                     Quarter Master General from the North River endeavour to have things put in better train." <emph render="italic"> Writings of GW</emph>, XXIII, 435.</p>

                  <p>Maps of French Army's Campsites 1-55, from Drinking Spring to Dedham, Massachusetts. The following series of maps depicts the army's camps on its march from Virginia to the Hudson and eventually to Boston. The cover sheet of the
                     "cahier," reproduced here, is the same as the one for the 1781 south-bound camps (No. 26) except for the heading "Amérique/ Campagne/ 1782." As with the earlier series, the maps are so oriented that the direction of the march
                     (generally northward in 1782) is at the top of the sheet; thus the two series appear reversed in relation to each other. In instances where the army camped in 1782 on a site previously occupied in 1781 the cartographer has not
                     repeated the map; the camp is merely recorded in the heading, with a cross-reference to the 1781 map. There are no detailed road maps for the 1782 marches. The route from Williamsburg to Spurrier's Tavern (19th camp, preceding
                     the 20th camp at Baltimore) is described mile by mile in Itinerary 6, which records the march of the wagon train when it took this route in the opposite direction in 1781.</p>
                  <p>The army moved northward from Williamsburg in four divisions, marching a day apart. The First Division, including the Bourbonnais Regiment, commanded by Major General Chastellux and led by Collot, left on 1 July; the Second
                     Division, including the Royal Deux-Ponts, commanded by Comte Christian de Deux-Ponts and led by Cromot Bubourg, on 2 July; the Third Division, including the Soissonnais, commanded by Comte de Viomenil and led by his nephew Comte
                     d'Ollone, on 3 July; the Fourth Division, including the Saintonge, commanded by Comte de Custine and led by the younger Berthier (Charles-Louis), on 4 July. Meanwhile, the Lauzun Legion had left Petersburg (see note to No. 106)
                     and proceeded via Kingsland Ferry, Richmond, North's Tavern on the Chickahominy, and Hanover Courthouse, to Littlepage's Bridge on the Pamunkey, at which point it became the vanguard of the army, preceding it by two days. The
                     Legion was commanded by the Marquis de Choisy (Lauzun himself had not yet returned from France) and led by Dumas and the elder Berthier (Louis-Alexandre). Rochambeau, who went ahead to confer with Washington in Philadelphia, did
                     not personally accompany the army on the first stages of the march.</p>

                     <p>Second Camp Two Miles beyond Byrd's Tavern. 2-5 July 1782. Eight miles from the previous camp. Byrd's (frequently written "Bird's") Tavern was earlier known as Doncastle's Ordinary and was situated about 2 miles south of
                        present Barhamsville. Since the French camped 2 miles beyond the tavern (which is not shown on the map), this would seem to place their camp at Barhamsville. The road branching off to the ight, not taken by the army, led to
                        Ruffin's Ferry, which crossed the Pamunkey above West Point.</p>

                     <p>Third Camp at Ratcliffe House. Seven miles from Byrd's Tavern (i.e., 5 miles from the previous camp, which was 2 miles beyond the tavern). The much corrected word "Rattelaffe" appears to be a copying error for "Ratcliffe."
                        There was evidently some uncertainty about the correct form. Verger in his journal writes it as "Radelassen." It has been variously transcribed in printed versions of other French officers' journals: e.g., "Ratelof"
                        (Blanchard) and "Ratilisse" (Vicomte de Rochambeau).</p>
                     <p>Although the exact location of the Ratcliffe property shown here has not been determined, it was probably along the present secondary road that goes from Barhamsville, via Slatersville, to New Kent Courthouse. The stream shown
                        on the map may perhaps be a portion of Beaverdam Creek. Cf. U.S. Geological Survey, Wlakers Quadrangle.</p>

                     <p>Fourth Camp at Hartfield. 4-7 July 1782. Seven and one half miles from the previous camp. The name "Hartfield," which should presumably read "Harfield," has disappeared from modern maps. A Micheal Harfield appears in the New
                        Kent County Tax List for 1782 (Virginia State Library), and Harfields are also mentions in the Vestry Book of St. Peter's Parish, part of which coincided with the western part of this county. Itinerary 6 describes the position
                        near "Hartfield House" (the building shown here on a small round hillock) as a very poor campsite. It was located some 3 miles northwest of New Kent Courthouse (through which the army had marches on its way here), alond the
                        old road to New Castle. The creek flowing into the Pamunkey, shown here on the map, is perhaps Big Creek or White House Creek. Cf. U.S. Geological Survey, Tunstall Qadrangle. The site of "The White House" home of Martha
                        Dandridge Custis at the time of her marriage to George Washington, is in this general region, as is the Pamunkey Indian Reservation across the river.</p>

                     <p>Fifth Camp at New Castle. 5-9 July 1782. Fifteen miles from the precious camp. There was an extra day's here for each of the divisions, so that two divisions were encamped here together on 6, 7, and 8 July, the Fourth Division
                        only of the 9th. Itinerary 6, describing the wagon train's 1781 march, speaks of New Castle as "a small town with very few houses, situarted on high ground. It is almost deserted. There are many plantations in the
                        neighborhood." More than a half century later, when Benson J. Lossing visited it in December 1848, he described it as "once a flourishing village, but now a desolation, only one house remaining upon its site" ( <emph render="italic">Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution</emph> [New York, 1851], II, 225). With the decline of river traffic and the changing pattern of agricultural economy in this section of Virginia, New Castle has now
                        wholly disappeared. It was situated a mile of so east of the present bridge over the Pamunky on the Richmond-Tappahanock road (U.S. Route 360), where a state historical marker recals Patrick Henry's "call to arms" at New
                        Castle.</p>

                        modern maps. The French camp was a mile beyond the little town shown here, which had been laid out by vote of the Virginia Assembly in 1762 near Page's Warehouse. The small stream on the map is a tributary of the Pamunkey. The
                        wagon train had camped here on 4 October 1781; see Itinerary 6, where it is recorded that Hanovertown and vicinity had suffered considerable damage from Cornwallis's raiders.</p>

                        was a mile of so beyond the river on the road (roughly present U.S. Route 301) leading north to Bowling Green. Itinerary 6 notes that the crossing of the Pamunkey was by a "wooden bridge." It was here at Littlepage's Bridge
                        that the route of march of Lauzun's Legion (which had come from Petersburg and Richmond) joined that of the rest of the army. From here on the Legion formed the vanguard.</p>

                     <p>Eighth camp ar Burk's Bridge or Kenner's Tavern. 9-12 July 1782. Twelve miles from the previous camp. Burk's Bridge, which crossed the Mattaponi some 9 mile south of Bowling Green, was in Caroline County along present U.S.
                        Route 301. John Burk was licensed as a tavernkeeper there. Although the wagon train did not camp at Burk's Bridge in 1781, the Itinerary describing its route notes that "a camp could be located in front of Burk's Brudge."
                        "Kenner's Tavern" (the building to the left of the letter "k") is called "Kenner's Red House" on Colles's 1789 road map (Plate 72); the Itinerary (1781) refers to it only as "the red house."</p>

                     <p>Ninth Camp at Bowling Green. 10-13 July 1782. Nine miles from the precious camp. Rochambeau's aide-de-camp Von Closen, who joined his regiment (Royal Deux-Ponts) here on 11 July, describes Bowling Green as "a small place where
                        there is only one tavern and the residence of Mr. John Hoomes, a very wealthy person, where we danced in the evening" (p. 210). The road branching off to the right, as indicated on the map, led to Caroline Courthouse, which
                        was some distance from the settlement at Bowling Green proper. A few years later the county seat was moved to Bowling Green, where the present county courthouse was erected on land provided for public use by John Hoomes. The
                        wagon train had made its 10th camp here on 2 October 1781. See Itinerary 6, where it is noted: "Neither camp nor headquarters would be very well situated here. It is nevertheless better than any other campsite in this
                        neighborhood."</p>

                     <p>Tenth Camp at Charles Thornton's House. 11-14 July 1782. Eight and one half miles from the previous camp. The camp was on high ground beyond Charles Thornton's house on the road leading north to Fredericksburg and Falmouth.
                        Some 2 miles beyond the campsite, but not shown on the map, was Todd's Ordinary (present Villboro, Caroline Country) where, according to Von Closen (p. 210), the headquarters was located. "Charles" Thornton's house was
                        evidently so designated in order to distinguish it from "Widow" Thornton's, another "Fine house," 2 miles or so to the south and past which the army had marched on its way to its camp. Both Thornton houses are mentioned in the
                        Itinerary (6) of the wagon train and are shown in Colles's <emph render="italic">Survey</emph>, Plates 70-71. When proceeding southward the wagon train had stopped to the east of the present route, at Colonel Dangerfield's
                        plantation on the banks of the Rappahannock, as described in a fragment of Berthier's journal, Itinerary 6, n. 33.</p>

                     <p>Eleventh Camp at Falmouth. 12-16 July 1782. Fourteen miles from the precious camp. There was a "sejour," or extra day's rest here for each of the four divisions, so that two were in camp at the same time, as shown. The
                        officers took advantage of the halt to make excursions in the vicinity. Clermont-Crèvecœur (p. 73)mentions a call on General Washington's mother in Fredericksburg (on the south bank of the Rappahannock, opposite Falmouth). Von
                        Closen (pp. 210-211) speaks of visits to William Fitzhugh's house (Chatham) and to General Alexander Spotswood's estate at New Post. Blanchard ([1], p. 110) states that he set up and left at Falmouth a temporary hospital for
                        60 sick, who were later brought to Baltimore.</p>

                        there the divisions following continued 3 miles farther to camp here at Peyton's Tavern. Several of the officer's journals metnion the hot weather and consequent importance of good spring water: e.g., Verger, p. 159. Peytons's
                        Ordinary, as the tavern was also called, was a few miles north of Stafford (county seat of Stafford County, on present U.S. Route 1). The stream shown here is Aquia Run according to Colles, <emph render="italic">Survey</emph>,

                     <p>Fourteenth Camp at Colchester. 16-19 July 1782. Ten miles from the previous camp at Dumfries. The town of Colchester, near the mouth of Occoquan Creek (east of present U.S. Route 1), was already in a state of decline when the
                        French army camped nearby. Verger (p. 159) describes it as "almost deserted." The infantry was ferried across the Occoquan, but the artiller was obliged to use a ford 4 miles upstream. The road to the for ( <emph render="italic">chemin du gué</emph>) is indicated on the map. Chastellux describes a meeting here with General Daniel Morgan: "I was then at Colchester, where the first division of the troops had just arrived, after having
                        crossed in boats a small river that flows near this town. The baggage train and the artillery had taken another route to reach a rather difficult ford. General Morgan met the baggage train when it was engaged in a narrow
                        gorge, and finding that the wagoners were not managing very well, he stopped and showed them how they should drive their wagons. After having put everything in order, he called at my quarters and had dinner with me. The
                        simplicity of his bearing and the nobility of his manners reminded me of those ancient Gallic or Germanic chiefs, who, when at peace with the Romans, came to visit them and offer assistance. He expressed great attachment to
                        the French nation, and great admiration for the fine appearance of our troops. . . ." Chastellux (4), II, 581.</p>

                     <p>Fifteenth Camp at Alexandria. 17-20 July 1782. Fifteen miles from the previous camp at Colchester. The road from Colchester, corresponding roughly to present U.S. Route 1, crossed Hunting Creek (not included on this map)
                        before coming into the town. The two small creeks shown here have subsequently been filled in. The "Meeting house" is the Old Presbyterian Meeting House, built in 1774 and still standing on South Fairfax Street between Wolfe
                        and Duke Streets. The army's camp seems to have been in the general vicinity of the present junction of Route 1 and the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway. George Grieve, who saw the French army in Alexandria, mentions that their
                        camp was on the ground previously occupied in 1755 by General Braddock's army; see his description cited above, Verger's journal, n. 121.</p>
                     <p>On the way from Colchester to Alexandria several of the French officers had turned aside from the route to visit Mount Vernon, where Mrs. Washington was in residence. See, e.g., Von Closen, pp. 212-214, and Blanchard (1), p.
                        111. It was at this time that Colonel Custine (commanding the Saintonge Regiment) presented to Mrs. Washington a set of porcelain from his factory at Niderviller in Lorraine.</p>

                     <p>Sixteenth Camp, a Mile and a Half beyond Georgetown. 18-21 July 1782. Eight miles from the previous camp at Alexandria. Details concerning the ferries over the Potomac, which the had crossed before reaching Georgetown (then in
                        Maryland) on the east bank of the river, are given in the description of the wagon train's 1781 march in the opposite direction, in Itinerary 6. The stream shown here is a small segment of Rock Creek in what is now the city of
                        Washington, D.C. The camp was located on high ground on the east bank of the creek, presumably in the vicinity of the present P Street Bridge, along the road from Georgetown to Bladensburg. In 1782 the District of Columbia was
                        still in the future and L'Enfant's geometric grid had not yet been superimposed on the old road pattern. Cf. Colles, <emph render="italic">Survey</emph>, Plate 65.</p>
                     <p>The army had covered the route from Williamsburg to Georgetown--167 miles according to the mileage figures on the maps--in 18 days (2 of them halts) and 16 marches. The wagon train, when proceeding southward by forced marches
                        over roughly the same route in September-October 1781, had covered it in 12 daily marches (no halts). Although the mileage estimates for the two marches do not exactly coincide, it would appear that the average daily march for
                        the army in July 1782 was a bit over 10 miles, whereas that for the wagon train in 1781 had been over 16 miles a day.</p>

                        coming in from Annapolis, is the route by which the wagon train led by L.-A. Berthier had arrived on 23 September 1781. Although it only passed through Bladensburg without stopping to camp, the itinerary describing its route
                        (Itinerary 6) notes that, if the army camped here, "headquarters would be well lodged on either side of the river, . . .there are fine campsites here, as well as pastures and forage."</p>

                        According to Von Closen (p. 215), the camp was "near Spurrier's Tavern...not far from Dorsay's house." At this point the army rejoined the route of its southbound march in September 1781. At that time it had reached Spurrier's
                        Tavern when news of the arrival of La Villebrune's ships, with adequate transports, determined the march southeastward to Annapolis. Cf. No. 162 and notes to Nos. 80 and 82.</p>

                     <p>Twentieth Camp at Baltimore. 24 July - 24 August 1782. During its month-long encampment here the army's positions were more extended than during the brief stop in Baltimore in September 1781; cf. Nos. 80 and 81. This time the
                        camp stretched southward from a point near present Franklin and Paca Streets (left of map) to a point near Hanover and Lee Streets. The steam west of the camp (shown at bottom of map) flowing into Ridgeley's Cove was the
                        Chatsworth Run, now lost beneath city pavements. Lauzun's Legion is shown in an advanced position on another height, in the vicinity of the present "old" Roman Catholic Cathedral (designed by Latrobe, dedicated in 1821).</p>
                     <p>When the army reached Baltimore, its subsequent destination was not generally known, though it was a matter of much specualtion among all the ranks. The decision to march north to join the Americans on the Hudson had been made
                        at a conference between Rochambeau and Washington in Philadelphia, 19 July (cf. Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, n. 155), and was subsequently confirmed in Washington's letter to Rochambeau, 16 August 1782 (<emph render="italic">Writings of GW</emph>, XXV, 26-28). "I am of opinion," Washington wrote from his headquarters at Newburgh, "that no good consequences can result from your remaining at Baltimore, but that many advantages may attend your
                        marching forward and forming a junction with this Army."</p>
                     <p>When the army marched north—the First Division on 24 August—Rochambeau left behind the detachments under La Valette and Chazelles that had been transported there from Virginia, as well as a hospital. They remained until May
                        1783, when they returned directly to France. Thus several hundred French soldiers were in Baltimore for nine month or so longer.</p>

                     <p>Accounts of the sojourn in Baltimore are included in the journals of Clermont-Crèvecœur (pp. 73-76) and of Verger (pp. 160-161). Clermont-Crèvecœur notes that the camp was "on a charming site in the midst of woodland near the

                     <p>Twenty-first Camp at White Marsh Forge. 24-27 August 1782. Twelve and a half miles from the preceding camp in Baltimore. The army marched in fourdivisions, with Lauzun's Legion vanguard, as far as Trenton. The camp at White
                        Marsh Forge was some 3 miles northeast of the so-called White Marsh camp where the army had stopped on its way south in September 1781; see No. 79. The "Etang" shown on the map is a pond formed by a dam in Honeygo Run, which
                        flows into White Marsh Run, where the forges is also shown. White Marsh Run is the head of Bird (or Back) River, which in turn flows into the Great Falls of the Gunpowder River.</p>

                     <p>"Twenty-second Camp at Bush Town." 25-28 August 1782. Twelve and a half miles from the preceding camp at White March Forge. The army had bivouacked here at Bush, in a slightly different position, in September 1781; cf. No. 78.
                        The main road leading through the town is present State Route 7. The road branching off to the left is the "road to Bald Friar Ford" (present Maryland State Road 136). On this northward march the entire army proceeded direclty
                        to Lower Ferry, whereas the previous year the artillery and wagons had made a detour via Bald Friar Ford (see note to No. 77). The building shown at the right of the map is Bush Mill; the millrace can be traced from Bynum Run
                        across the highway to the mill.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-third Camp at Lower Ferry. 26-30 August 1782. Twelve miles from the preceding camp at Bush. There was an extra day's halt here for each of the hour divisions. In September 1781 the army had bivouacked on the west bank
                        of the river (present Havre de Grace side), as shown on map, No. 77. This time the camp was on the east bank (present Perryville side). The entire army, including the artillery and wagons, was ferried across. Von Closen (then
                        accompanying General Rochambeau, who was riding with the First Division) notes in his journal (pp. 227-228) that boats and "skows" had been sent on ahead from Baltimore. "Before crossing the river," he adds, "we had an
                        excellent lunch at the house of the proprietor of the ferry, where we saw one of the pretty local girls--referred to thereaftter in our conversation as <emph render="italic">Miss Susquehanna</emph>."</p>

                     <p>Twenty-fourth Camp at Head of Elk [in Maryland]. 28-31 August 1782. Fifteen miles from the preceding camp at Lower Ferry. The stream shown at right is Big Elk Creek. The entire army had been united here at Head of Elk the
                        previous year when expecting to embark for transportation down the Chesapeake Bay. Cf. No. 76. The present map does not show the waterfront at Elk Landing, since it had no significance during the 1782 march. The slightly
                        different locations of the two encampments can be determined by reference to the triangular road intersection shown on both maps.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-fifth Camp at Newport [in Delaware]. 29 August - 1 September 1782. Sixteen and a half miles from the preceding camp at Elkton, Maryland. The route from Elkton to Newport--the same taken in the opposite direction the
                        previous year—is shown on the road map, No. 60. The Second Brigade had camped here in Newport in 1781 (cf. No. 59), but in a position differing slightly from the one shown on the present map of the 1782 encampment (by
                        divisions). The main road, to the right of which the army camped, is present Market Street (State Route 4). THe street intersecting this, at the top of the map, is State Route 41.</p>
                     <p>The next camp was at Chester, Pennsylvania. The army thus marched through Wilmington without camping there, as one brigade had done in 1781 (cf. No. 75). It may also be noted here that the Lauzun Legion, which remained in
                        America after the rest of Rochambeau's army had departed, was quartered in or near Wilmington during the winter of 1782-1783. It embarked for France, with the detachments left at Baltimore, in May 1783. The exact location of
                        the Legion's cantonment in Wilmington has not been determined; no map of it was been found by the Editors.</p>

                     <p>Twenty-seventh Camp at Philadelphia. 31 August - 4 September 1782. Sixteen miles from the preceding camp near Chester. The four divisions, preceded by Lauzun's Legion as a vanguard, marched on successive days through the city
                        to their camp on its northern outskirts; the previous year the camp had been on the banks of the Schuylkill near the present Market Street Bridge (cf. No. 73). There was at least one extra day's halt here for each of the
                        divisions. The map shows three regiments and three artillery units, as well as Lauzun's cavalry (yellow and white), in camp at the same time. The First Division (including the Bourbonnais Regiment) resumed its march northward
                        on 2 September.</p>
                     <p>The camp ground was along the eastern side of the "Chemin de German Town," indicated on the map as a continuation of Second Street. It was on high ground north of Cohocksink Creek, the larger o the two streams shown, with a
                        dike ("Digue") across its mouth. The smaller stream, marking the northern limit of the regular street grid, is Pegg's Run, also known as Conocuonocue Creek. Both streams have long since been obliterated. The French camp was
                        thus in the general vicinity of the junction of present North Second Street and Germantown Avenue. An interesting comparison can be made between this 1782 camp plan and John Hill's "Plan of the City of Philadelphia" (engraved
                        and published, 1797). The Hills plan, on which the locality is called "Bath," shows that streets had been laid out and many houses constructed there during the postwar years.</p>
                     <p>The army resumed its march northward by the road designated here as "Chemin de Read-Lyon's Tavern" (Frankforn Avenue). The stay in Philadelphia, with its attendant festivities, is described in the journals of
                        Clermont-Crèvecœur (pp. 77-78) and Verger (pp. 162-163).</p>

                     <p>Thirty-first Camp at Somerset Courthouse [Millstone, New Jersey]. Also "Camp à Read Lion T., Le 2 Septembre, 15 miles de Philadelphie - manque" [no map], "Camp à Trenton, Le 3 Septembre, 16 miles de Read Lion Voyés campagne
                        1781, 25eme Camp. Le 4, 5, et 6 Sejour" [no map], "Camp à Prince-Town, Le 7 Septembre, 12 miles de Trentown. Voyés campagne 1781, 24e Camp" [no map]. 8-9 September 1782. Fourteen miles from the preceding camp at Princeton. The
                        camp ground at Somerset Courthouse was in a slightly different location from that of 1781, as can be seen by comparison with maps Nos. 53 and 68. This time two regiments were placed on the bank of the Millstone, east of the
                        road and opposite the church. The main road shown here is present State Route 533; the second (from the top) of the three roads crossing the Millstone and leading to New Brunswick is approximately present State Route 514.</p>
                     <p>As indicated in the heading, no new maps for the preceding camps at Red Lion Tavern (28th), Trenton (29th), and Princeton (30th) are included in this series, the army having camped in the same positions as in 1781; cf. Nos.
                        72, 70, and 69. On the present march, after leaving Trenton, the army marched northward through New Jersey by brigades: the First included the Bourbonnais and Royal Deux-Ponts regiments, the Second, the Saintonge and
                        Soissonnais. Covering the main corps on its right, the Lauzun Legion, commanded by Colonel Robert-Guillaume Dillon, took a route farther to the east, proceeding in seven marches via (1) Kingston, (2) New Brunswick, (3) Scotch
                        Plains, (4) Chatham, (5) The Forks (Two Bridges), (6) Paramus, and (7) Kakiat (New Hempstead, New York) before joining up with the army at Haverstraw prior to crossing the Hudson at King's Ferry. At this time the enemy still
                        occupied New York, and there were rumors of reinforcements arriving there. See Von Closen's journal, p. 234, and Verger's journal, n. 145.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-second Camp at Bullion's Tavern [Liberty Corner]. 9-10 September 1782. Thirteen miles from the preceding camp at Somerset Courthouse (Millstone). The same route had been taken in the opposite direction in 1781. See No.
                        53 and also No. 67 for the 1781 camp at Bullion's Tavern. The locations of the two encampments differ slightly. The pattern of roads shown on the map can readily be recognized in the present village of Liberty Corner. The
                        "chemin de Somerset-Court-house," lower right, is present State Route 525, coming into Liberty Corner over Second Watchung Mountain from Martinsville. The road to Whippany (the next day's destination), upper left, is the road
                        from Liberty Corner to Lyons and Basking Ridge.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-fourth Camp at Pompton Meetinghouse [Pompton Plains]. Also "Camp à Wippany, le 10 Septembre, 16 miles de Bulllion's Tavern. Voyès la Campagne 1781, 21e camp. (Le 11 Séjour)" [no map]. 12-13 September 1782. Fifteen miles
                        from the previous camp at Whippany, where each of the two brigades had remained an extra day. No new map of the Whippany camp was included in this series, since the camp was in the same position in 1781; see No. 66.</p>
                     <p>There had also been a camp at Pompton Plains the previous year (No. 65), but since the present camp is in a slightly different position, there is a new map. Comparison of the two maps and reference to the "Metting-house,"
                        shown on both, indicate that the greater part of the troops camped this time on the eastern side of the main road. In both instances, as indicated by the points on the symbols for regiments, the camp "faces" the enemy, who
                        occupied Manhattan and Staten Islands to the eastward. This 1782 map includes a larger area than the earlier one, extending northward to the bridges across the river at the top of the sheet. (The two branches of the Pompton
                        are called the Pequannock and Wanaque on modern maps.) An advance unit is shown here near the river crossing, where a small work protecting a strategic point in the road communication system is situated. The road branching off
                        to the left (labeled upside down) went to Ringwood and thence, via The Clove, to New Windsor, which is on the Hudson above West Point. The road here designated as "Chemin de Suffrantz" sent to present Pompton Lakes (Passaic
                        County), then through the Ramapo Valley (present U.S. Route 202) to Suffern, New York, the next camp. This route is shown on map, No. 50, and is described in Itinerary 3.</p>

                        which appears reversed in relation to the present one, it being the cartographer's practice to orient his map with the direction of the march at the top of the sheet.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-sixth Camp at Haverstraw. 14-16 September 1782. Fifteen and a half miles from the preceding camp at Suffern. The First Brigade remained here for three days, the Second Brigade for two, before crossing the Hudson at
                        King's Ferry on 17 September. The First Brigade camped on this site already used the previous year (cf. No. 63) north of Cedar Pond Brook, in what is now the village of stony Point. The Second Brigade camped farther south,
                        along the road leading from the village of Haverstraw to "Smith-house." This was the house of Joshua Hett Smith, later known as "Treason House," where Arnold and Andre spent the night of 21-22 September 1780; the site is now
                        occupied by the New York State Rehabilitation Hospital (West Haverstraw). The stream at the far right of the map is Minisceongo Creek.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-seventh Camp at Peekskill. 17-23 September 1782. Nine and a half miles from the preceding camp at Haverstraw. The entire army is shown in camp here (Lauzun's Legion, at right, nearest the Hudson) on hillocks to the
                        south of the village of Peekskill. The site is in the southern part of the now-populated part of Peekskill. The small stream at top of map (south) is Dickey Brook; the single peak beyond it, Blue Mountain. For its relationship
                        to the larger general area, see maps of the 1781 campaign, Nos. 48 and 62. On the way to its camp here at Peekskill the French army had crossed the Hudson at King's Ferry (Stony Point to Verplanck's Point) and then marched
                        past the American camp, which was closer to the ferry landing. The French halted at Peekskill for a week before proceeding on 24 September, eastward and farther inland, to their next camp at Hunt's Tavern (also referred to as
                        the Crompond encampment). </p>

                     <p>Thirty-eighth Camp at Hunt's Tavern. 24 September - 21 October 1782. Eight miles from the preceding camp at Peekskill. The army had already camped here the previous year, as shown on map, No. 61. The road running from the
                        bottom to the top of the sheet (shouth) is Crompond Road, present State Route 35 (U.S. 202) in the town of Yorktown, New York. The lower or the two roads leading into it from the right is present Baldwin Road. Hunt's Tavern
                        (not so labeled on this map) is the house situated at this junction. The road leading off at this point to the left (which the army would eventually take when resuming its march to Salem Center) is present Hallock's Mill Road.
                        An outlet of Crom Pond (the larger of the two "Etangs") curves around the high ground where part of the army camped behind the tavern and then crosses Hallock's Mill Road. The "Qier Gal" (Quartier General), i.e., Rochambeau's
                        Headquarters, was situated here in Samuel Delevan's house. For the story of Delevan's claims against the General, see Verger's journal, n. 158. The position of the "Hunt's Tavern camp" within the general "Crompond" area is
                        shown on the next map.</p>

                     <p>Thirty-ninth Camp at Salem [Salem Center, Westchester County, New York]. 22-23 October 1782. Thirteen and a half miles from the Hunt's tavern (Crompond) camp. The route from Hunt's Tavern via Hait's (or Haight's) Tavern
                        (Somers) and Dean's Bridge (Purdys), to Salem is described (in reverse) in the 1781 "Itinerary from Providence to the Campe at Philipsburg." This portion of the route had not, however, been taken in 1781, because of the change
                        in itinerary; see note to map, No. 24. Thus the army marched over this road for the first time in 1782. From here to Providence, Rhode Island, the march was by brigades: the Bourbonnais Brigade (including the Bourbonnaid and
                        Royal Deux-Ponts regiments) a day ahead of the Soissonnais Brigade (including the Soissonnais and Saintonge regiments).</p>
                     <p>The locality here designated as "Salem" is now known as Salem Center, which is in the town of North Salem, Westchester County, New York, near the Connecticut line. The stream at the right of the map is the TIticus River (its
                        enlargement into the Titicus Reservoir now begins at approximately the point shown at the bottom of the map). The road running parallel to the river is present State Route 116. The two roads branching off to the right and
                        leading to Bedford corrsepond roughly to present Turk Hill Road and June Road.</p>
                     <p>The building on the left-hand side of the road in the center of the map (to the right of the letters "em" in Salem") is the manor house built ca. 1773 by the Loyalist Stephen Delancey. During the Revolution it was confiscated
                        by the patriots and used as a courthouse and jail. From 1790 to 1884 it was occupied by the North Salem Academy and since that time has been the Town Hall for the town of North Salem..</p>

                     <p>Fortieth Camp at Danbury [in Connecticut]. 23-24 October 1782. Eleven miles from the preceding camp at Salem Center, New York. When marching to Danbury the army passed through Ridgbury where it had camped the previous year
                        (cf. No. 37); henceforth it followed, in the opposite direction, the route already taken in 1781. The road from Ridgebury to Danbury is shown on map, No. 23.</p>
                     <p>The road at the lower right coming in from the previous camp at Salem is present West Wooster Street, which joins Main Street at right angles. The "Meeting house" shown at this point is the Congregational Church, no longer
                        standing; its site was near the present County Courthouse. The route went right to the foot of Main Street, then left into South Street. The second "Meeting house" shown here is the early Episcopal Church, which has also
                        disappeared from this site. A bit farther along, a road (approximately present Coal Pit Hill Road) branches right (south) to Stratford and Newtown. Beyond this junction, on high ground to the north of the road, two regiments
                        camped. The artillery was farther forward near the bank of the Simpaug, a small tributary of the Still River. After crossing the brook the route (corresponding to present Shelter Rock Road) led on towards Newtown, as shown on
                        map, No. 23.</p>
                     <p>The "hôpital" in the lower part of the map was a military hospital maintained by the Americans, which local tradition places in the "Hoyt House" on present Park Avenue.</p>

                     <p>Forty-fourth Camp at Farmington. Also "Camp à New-Town, le 24 Octobre, 12 miles de Dambury; Voyés Campagne 1781, 10e Camp. (le 25 Séjour)" [no map], "Camp à Break-Neck, le 26 Octobre, 15 miles de New-Town. Voyés Campagne 1781,
                        9e Camp" [no map], "Camp à Barn's Tavern, le 27 Octobre, 13 Miles de Break-Neck. Voyès campagne 1781. 8e Camp" [no map]. 28-29 October 1782. Thirteen miles from the preceding camp at Barnes's Tavern (in Marion). On the march
                        from Danbury to Farmington the army had camped at Newtown (41st camp, 24-26 October 1782), Break Neck (42nd camp, 26-27 October), and Barnes's Tavern (43rd camp, 27-28 October), but no new maps are included in the present
                        series since the positions were the same as those occupied on the 1781 southward march. Cf. Nos. 36, 35, and 34. The route is shown on Nos. 23, 22, 21, and 20.</p>
                     <p>The army had camped in Farmington the previous year during its southward march, but the campsite had then been south of the village, as shown on No. 33. The 1782 camp was in a different location, more in the village, as shown
                        on the present map. The brook, when proceeding north along Main Street, is a road leading west, corresponding to present Meadow Road. The camp of the infantry regiments would thus have been roughly along the line of present
                        Garden Street; the artillery and wagons camped east of Main Street along Hatter's Lane.</p>
                     <p>The general street plan of Farmington, as shown here, has changed little over the years. Many of these houses still stand. The building enclosed in a small square in the upper part of the map is the Congregational Church,
                        built in 1772-1773 by Judah Woodruff.</p>

                     <p>Forty-fifth Camp at East Hartford. 29 October - 5 November 1782. Twelve and a half miles from the preceding camp at Farmington. Owing to the extra <emph render="italic">séjour</emph>, or halt, the entire army was encamped here
                        together, as shown, from 30 October through 4 November. The camp was east of the village and of the Hockanum River, on either side of the road to Bolton Center. When the army stopped here the previous year, only one regiment
                        (Soissonnais) camped in this position. The other regiments had been west of the village closer to the banks of the Connecticut in an area not included on the present map; cf. No. 32.</p>
                     <p>It was here at East Hartford that Rochambeau announced that the army would march to Boston and embark there for the West Indies. Many had hitherto supposed that they would remain in winter quarters at Hartford; cf.
                        Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, p. 81. See also Von Closen, pp. 263-264, and Chastellux (4), II, 477.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Ezra Stiles, journeying westward with his wife, met up with the French army at this time. He noted in his diary (4 November) that he saw the First Division at Bolton (where General Rochambeau visited him at the Reverend
                        Mr. Colton's house), and then, on 5 November, when proceeding from Bolton to East Hartford: "Met &amp; passed the 2d. Div. of French Army, probably 1500 men. The whole sd. to be 4000, I judge 3000. We stopt our chaise near
                        half an hour in passing the Troops, &amp; afterwards above half an hour in passing 2 Divisions of Wagons, I judge 200. Some of them sd. they had 500 Waggons for whole Army. . . ."</p>

                     <p>Forty-sixth Camp, Two Miles beyond Bolton Meetinghouse. 4-5 November 1782. Fourteen miles from the preceding camp at East Hartford. In June 1781 the army had camped hear Bolton Meetinghouse (present Bolton Center), as shown on
                        Nos. 17 and 31. This time the camp was 2 miles beyond the meetinghouse (i.e., southeastward) in a position that appears to be near the Hop River and one of its small tributaries. This would be in the southwestern corner of the
                        present town of Coventry, or northwestern corner of the present town of Andover (incorporated separately in 1848), along present U.S. Route 6.</p>

                     <p>Fifty-second Camp at Providence. Also "Camp à Waterman's Tavern, le 9 Novembre, 10 miles de Walen-Town. Voyés Campagne 1781, 2e Camp" [no map], "Camp à Providence, le 10 Novembre, 15 miles de Waterman's Tavern, l'armée sur
                        deux Lignes dans l'ancien Camp de la Brigade de Soissonnois. Voyés la Campagne 1781, 1er Camp" [no map]. 13 November - 4 December 1782. Proceeding from Voluntown (Sterling Hill) the army made its next (50th) camp at Waterman's
                        Tavern on the site occupied the previous year (cf. Nos. 14 and 28) and then, upon reaching Providence, camped again (51st camp) on the western outskirts of the town, as it had done in June 1781 when beginning the march to the
                        Hudson (cf. Nos. 14 and 27).</p>
                     <p>After pausing for three days on the former camp ground the two brigades marched through Providence to another site north of town, as shown on the present map. According to Von Closen (p. 267), the move was determined by the
                        landowner's refusal to agree to the cutting of wood on his property. The new camp, described my Verger as "barracks in a wood" (p. 169), was on the farm of Jeremiah Dexter, overlooking the Boston road, in what was then North
                        Providence. Present Camp Street and Rochambeau Avenue are in the vicinity.</p>
                     <p>The troops remained here in North Providence until Vaudreuil's ships at Boston were ready to receive them. They left successively in four divisions: Bourbonnais on I December, Soissonnais on the 2nd, Saintonge of the 3rd, and
                        Royal Deux-Ponts on the 4th. The artillery, however, had left Providence for Boston a fortnight earlier (16-17 November), "because of the large amount of materiel to be embarked" (cf. Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, p. 81).</p>
                     <p>The inclusion of a stretch of the "Pattukey River" (i.e., the Pawtucket, now called the Seekonk), upper right of th map, is a reminder that a French vessel, the Fantasque, was anchored here. As noted by Verger (p. 169), a
                        detachment commanded by M. d'Espeyron, major of the Soissonnais Regiment, comprising one company from each of the four regiments, was embarked on the Fantasque, also used as a hospital ship. This vessel, which was in bad
                        repair, did not join Vaudreuil's fleet as planned and remained here until early February 1783. Thus French soldiers were to be seen in Providence for another two months after the departure of the main corps of the army.</p>
                     <p>It was at Providence that General Rochambeau took leave of his army and handed over the command to Baron de Vioménil.</p>

                     <p>Fifty-fourth Camp at Dedham. 2-5 December 1782. Sixteen miles from the preceding camp at Wrentham. The road from Wrentham coming in at the lower left of the map crosses a small stream (Lowder Brook) before joining another
                        road, which in turn leads to the "Meeting House" (Congregational Church) on Dedham Common. The river at the top of the map is the Charles. The camp was southeast of present St. Paul's Church on ground lying between present
                        Court, School, Washington, Worthington, and Richards Streets.</p>
                     <p>Pages from the manuscript diary of a Dedham resident, Dr. Nathaniel Ames, noting the passage of the French artillery on 17 November and of the four infantry regiments on 2, 3, 4, and 5 December, are reproduced in Forbes and
                        Cadman, I, 178. "Camp à Boston, Le 3 de décembre, 11 miles de Dedam." Although the preceding map notes a "55th camp at Boston," no plan of it is included in this series and probably none was drawn. This apparent lacuna may be
                        explained that there was no "camp," strictly speaking, in Boston. Arriving in succession on 3, 4, 5, and 6 December, the troops were immediately embarked on ships lying in the harbor, as noted in several of the officers'
                        journals.</p>

                  <p>Field Sketch for the Map of Camp at Farmington. This rough pencil sketch of Farmington appears on the verson of a memorandum noting the timetable and distances for the march of the two brigades from Hunt's Tavern to East
                     Hartford, 22-31 October 1782. It provides an unusual example (the only one known to the Editors) of Berthier's rapid on-the-spot notations that he later worked up into finished maps. Other such field sketches were presumably made
                     day by day as a cumulative record of the camps and marches of the army. The training of the topographical engineers emphasized quick and accurate observation in circumstances that precluded the use of regular surveying
                     instruments. The reconnoiterer must then count his own paces, or his horse's, to determine distances from point to point along the road. As he proceeds he must observe and note roughly on his paper "rivers, brooks, canals,
                     bridges, fords, ravines, swamps, mountains, woods, wayside shrines, mills, gallows, and anything else he meets up with." He must sight such distant landmarks as towers, belfries, and windmills in order to establish the direction
                     of the road. And, if time allows, he should also go up into some high building and sketch the surrounding country.</p>

               <p>Consists of Berthier's account of the trip he took in Germany and Austria during the summer of 1783 to observe the maneuvers of the war machine organized by Frederick II. The manuscript indicates that he traveled alone, by post most
                  of the time, hiring a horse occasionally to visit a battlefield. He was probably the only French observer following the military operations that year.</p>
