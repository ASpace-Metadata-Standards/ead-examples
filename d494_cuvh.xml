            <p>Floyd Halleck Higgins was born on May 15, 1886, in Keokuk, Iowa. After graduating from Iowa State College
                in Ames, he moved to Chicago and western Canada to work in a variety of public relations positions
                including Director of Public Relations, National Association of Farm Equipment Manufacturers
                (1922-1926). Higgins moved to California in 1927 where he became the News Editor for Caterpillar Tractor
                Company. He immediately found that farm machinery history "was gathered by each company's ad men when
                they needed to get up something for a 'special number' of some publication in which its ads appeared."
                In self defense, Higgins began collecting materials relating to the origins of combines and tractors but
                his interests expanded to include all forms of farm mechanization.</p>
            <p>In 1933, Caterpillar moved its corporate headquarters to Peoria, Illinois. Higgins chose to stay in
                California where he worked as a free-lance writer. His articles appeared in <title>Pacific Rural
                    Press</title>, <title>Farm Implement News</title>, <title>Diesel Progress</title>, <title>Rice
                    Journal</title>, and other agricultural journals. He used every opportunity to interview "the men
                who were there" and create an historical record supported by material in his ever-growing
                collection.</p>
            <p>In 1959, Higgins sold his collection of more than ninety file cabinet drawers of research materials, to
                the University of California, Davis. The University Library hired him to remain the curator of the
                collection, a position he held until 1972 when ill health forced him to retire. He died on February 28,
                1975.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>This finding aid is for the portion of the collection that is images of Mexican sugar beet workers in
                California. </p>
            <p>In 1942, F. Hal Higgins, a free-lance journalist and Safeway Farm Reporter, was given the job of
                providing publicity for the Mexican workers coming into California to harvest sugar beets. This was a special,
                informal program funded by the United States government under the Farm Security Administration. It is
                considered the beginning of what is now called the Bracero System.</p>
            <p>"The spontaneous and irregular migration that prevailed gave way abruptly to one that was supervised and
                regulated by government." (<title>Merchants of Labor; the Mexican Bracero Story</title>, Ernesto
                Galarza, 1964). The 3000 Mexican men were carefully selected by the Mexican Government, the United
                States Government, and California Field Crops, Inc. to harvest the sugar beet crop. The sugar beet crop
                was especially large and there was a shortage of farm workers due to World War II. Also called Stoop
                Laborers, or Good Neighbor workers by Higgins, the Mexican workers came to top and harvest sugar
                beets.</p>
            <p><title>Mexican Nationals in California Agriculture 1942-1959</title>, California Department of
                Employment, 1959, states, "World War II created conditions and demands which seriously depleted
                California's farm manpower resources at a time when farmers were being called upon to augment production
                of food and fiber to maintain civilian and military life...Early in 1942, California farmers faced a
                critical labor shortage…Sugar beet growers made the first World War II request for Mexican labor..." </p>
            <p>Higgins explained in a letter that he tried "to catch a lot of the social side in pictures." In
                    <title>Photographing Farmworkers in California</title>, author Richard Steven Street states that
                "Higgins followed the braceros out into the countryside, creating a highly original essay on the
                vanguard of a labor program that would eventually entice one out of every nine Mexican men north." The
                photographs show many aspects of the workers lives: arriving by train, building of the labor camps,
                dining and entertainment, and working in the fields. The photographs were taken mainly in the
                agricultural areas of the California communities of Woodland, Clarksburg, Manteca, Pleasanton, and
                Salinas. The descriptions contained in some entries were made by F. Hal Higgins.</p>

                    <p>The sugar beet harvest in 1942 was a bumper crop with no workers to harvest it because of World
                        War II. California farmers asked the United States government to invite Mexico to send Mexican
                        workers to California to help harvest the estimated 8 million hundred-pound bags of sugar beets.
                        Three thousand workers were used to harvest the crop, topping and harvesting the sugar
                        beets.</p>
