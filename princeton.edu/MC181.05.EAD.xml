         <p>George Stanley McGovern (1922-2012) was a United States American senator and Democratic
            presidential nominee known for his strong liberal stance. The second of four children,
            he was born in Avon, South Dakota, in 1922 to Joseph C. McGovern, a Wesleyan Methodist
            pastor, and Frances McGovern (née McLean). George McGovern enrolled at Dakota Wesleyan
            University in Mitchell, S.D., in 1940. While at Dakota Wesleyan, he joined the Dakota
            Wesleyan Varsity Debate Squad, winning the South Dakota Intercollegiate Oratory Contest
            in 1941 and the Red River Valley Tournament in 1943.</p>
         <p>McGovern earned a pilot's license through the Civilian Pilot Training Program and
            enlisted in the Air Force following the attacks on Pearl Harbor. He began training in
            February, 1943, and was deployed in the fall of 1944 to an airbase near Cerignola in
            Northern Italy. In the following ten months preceeding his discharge in July 1945, he
            flew 35 bomber missions with B-24 Liberators over targets in Europe, including Linz,
            Vienna, and Munich, as well as a number of food relief flights following the surrender
            of Germany. In honor of his wife Eleanor, he named any plane he piloted the "Dakota
            Queen," a practice he later extended to his campaign planes. McGovern was awarded the
            Air Medal for heroism in battle.</p>
         <p>Returning to Dakota Wesleyan in 1945 to finish his studies under the G.I. Bill, McGovern
            earned his B.A. in 1946 and went on to study divinity at the Garrett Theological
            Seminary in Evanston, Illinois. Dissatisfied with the ministry, he enrolled at
            Northwestern University, earning his M.A. in History in 1949. He returned to Dakota
            Wesleyan as a professor of history and political science while also continuing his
            studies with Arthur S. Link at Northwestern. In 1953, he received his Ph.D. in history
            with his dissertation, <emph render="italic">"The Colorado Coal Strike,
               1913-1914"</emph>.</p>
         <p>Though raised a Republican, McGovern became a supporter of Henry Wallace, serving as a
            delegate from Illinois for the Progressive Party Convention in Philadelphia in 1948. In
            1952, Adlai Stevenson's acceptance speech following his nomination as the Democratic
            presidential candidate moved McGovern to register as a Democrat. He left Dakota Wesleyan
            the following year to become the executive secretary of the Democratic Party in South
            Dakota and spent the following years revitalizing the party's presence in the
            traditionally conservative state.</p>
         <p>In 1956, McGovern successfully ran for Congress and became the United States
            Representative for the First District of South Dakota, winning reelection against Joe
            Foss in 1958. During his four years in the House of Representatives, McGovern served on
            the Committee on Education and Labor and on the Committee on Agriculture, where he
            advocated strongly for rural development, food stamp legislation, and foreign food aid.
            These themes would characterize his subsequent political career.</p>
         <p>McGovern challenged Karl Mundt for his Senate seat in 1960. Though the campaign focused
            on rural issues, McGovern's political ties to Robert and John F. Kennedy, whose Catholic
            background was unpopular in South Dakota, ultimately contributed to his defeat. In a
            phone call to his brother at the time, John F. Kennedy said "I think we just cost that
            nice guy a Senate seat," and subsequently offered McGovern a position in his
            administration as Special Assistant to the President.</p>
         <p>In that function, McGovern served as the director of the Food for Peace Program from
            January 1961-July 1962. During that time, McGovern leveraged the agricultural surplus of
            the U.S., which had frequently been viewed as a problem since it lowered farm profits,
            to alleviate world hunger and improve foreign relations. When McGovern left office to
            run again for the Senate, Food for Peace was operating in twelve countries.</p>
         <p>In 1962, McGovern won a Senate seat against Joseph Bottum, who had been appointed
            following Francis Case's unexpected death earlier that year. He was subsequently
            reelected in 1968 and 1974 and served in the Senate until 1981. When McGovern joined the
            88th Congress in 1963, he joined the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry and the
            Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and from the start developed a strong stance
            on farm prices, rural development, and food programs. After 1967, when he assumed the
            chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs, McGovern also became an outspoken
            advocate for the rights of Native Americans and for improving education and employment
            opportunities on the reservations. In addition, McGovern consistently challenged
            military and defense spending, a position that correlated with his opposition to the war
            in Vietnam and which became one of his central tenets. In 1969, McGovern became the
            chairman of the newly created Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs and, in
            1978, of its successor, the Subcommittee on Nutrition. The committee played a major role
            in developing legislation for food stamp and school lunch programs, and explored the
            relationship between nutrition and health. In 1977, the Select Committee issued a
            seminal report, <emph render="italic">Dietary Goals for the United States</emph> (known
            as the "McGovern Report"), which advocated a decrease in the consumption of fats and
            refined sugars, and an increase in the consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber.
            The report is the precursor of today's <emph render="italic">Dietary Guidelines for
               Americans</emph>.</p>
         <p>McGovern campaigned briefly for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 following
            the assassination of Robert Kennedy, announcing his candidacy on August 10 and losing
            the nomination to Hubert Humphrey during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago
            three weeks later. At the convention, a motion was passed to establish the Commission on
            Party Structure and Delegate Selection, of which McGovern became the chairman when it
            began work in 1969. The commission significantly strengthened the role of caucuses and
            primaries and set quotas for women, youth, and minority delegates.</p>
         <p>In 1972, McGovern won his party's nomination and ran for president against Richard Nixon
            on a platform that emphasized withdrawal from Vietnam and more equitable social welfare
            programs. While McGovern had been able to attract an enthusiastic following during the
            primaries partly based on his perception as an idealistic, anti-establishment candidate,
            his campaign was damaged by the discovery that his vice-presidential candidate, Senator
            Thomas Eagleton, had a history of psychiatric illness. Eagleton's removal from the
            ticket was viewed by many voters as political opportunism, causing the campaign to lose
            substantial support. In addition, the campaign lost momentum when the Nixon
            administration reduced troop levels in Vietnam, thereby deflating one of McGovern's main
            campaign issues. In addition, McGovern represented the left wing of the Democratic Party
            and was unable to attract the support of moderates. Given these factors combined with
            the power of incumbency wielded by his opponent, McGovern lost in a landslide to Richard
            Nixon, carrying only the state of Massachusetts.</p>
         <p>In 1980, McGovern lost his Senate reelection bid in the course of the "Reagan
            Revolution" that swept many Democrats from office. He subsequently ran unsuccessfully
            for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 against (among others) Jesse Jackson,
            Walter Mondale, and Gary Hart, who had been his campaign manager in 1972. He considered
            a renewed attempt for the nomination in 1992 but ultimately decided against it,
            deferring to the wishes of his family.</p>
         <p>After electoral politics, McGovern continued to work to alleviate world hunger, serving
            as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and on the
            board of the Friends of the World Food Program. In 2001, he was appointed the United
            Nations Global Ambassador on World Hunger. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom
            in 2000.</p>
         <p>George McGovern was married to Eleanor Stegeberg McGovern (1921-2007). The couple had
            five children: Ann, Steven, Susan, Mary, and Terry (Teresa), who died 1994 from exposure
            related to alcohol addiction. Her death prompted George McGovern to author the book
               <emph render="italic">Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with
               Alcoholism</emph> and to help create the Teresa McGovern Center, a non-profit
            treatment facility for substance abuse patients.</p>
         <p>George McGovern died on October 21, 2012 at age 90.</p>

               <p>Series 5 documents a major portion of George McGovern's political career,
                  including most years in the House of Representatives (1957-1960), his service as
                  Special Assistant to the President and director of the Food for Peace Program
                  (1961-1962), and his senatorial career (1962-1981). In addition, the series
                  contains campaign materials from McGovern's House and Senate campaigns as well as
                  his 1972 presidential campaign and his unsuccessful bids for the Democratic
                  presidential nomination in 1968 and 1984. The material dating from 1981-1984 is of
                  particular interest as no other series of the George S. McGovern Papers documents
                  this time period. The series contains film footage, video recordings, audiotapes
                  and audiocassettes, computer tapes and diskettes, and other formats.</p>
