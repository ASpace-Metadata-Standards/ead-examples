      <head>Biographical Narrative</head>
      <p>Colby E. "Babe" Slater, was born on April 30, 1896 in Berkeley, California to Louise and John Slater. Babe, the youngest
      child, had two brothers and a sister. The Slaters lived in San Francisco before moving to Berkeley. The family's fortunes
      reversed when John Slater, a prosperous sea captain, died in 1908. Babe and his older brother Norman attended Berkeley High
      School, played on the school's athletic teams, and participated in sporting events on the University of California campus. In
      1911 and 1912, Babe Slater led the Berkeley High School rugby team to county, regional, and state titles.</p>
      <p>In 1914, Babe Slater left Berkeley High School to attend the University Farm School in Davis (now the University of
      California, Davis). The University Farm School, a branch of the University of California's College of Agriculture, offered a
      three-year course in the principles and practices of agriculture. While at the University Farm, Slater starred in rugby,
      football, basketball, and baseball. He served as Basketball Team Captain, Junior Class President, House Manager for the
      Calpha Fraternity, Thanksgiving Day Special Chairman, Picnic Day Parade Chairman, and Picnic Day General Chairman.</p>
      <p>When Slater graduated from the University Farm School in May 1917, the First World War was underway. America declared war
      on Germany on April 6, 1917. Slater registered for the newly instated draft in June 1917, enlisted in the United States Army
      in September, and was promoted to Corporal in November. In the spring of 1918, he led a group of Yolo County "Liberty Boys"
      as they traveled by train from Woodland, California to Camp Lewis, American Lake, Washington, where they underwent intensive
      training for war. Slater's company arrived in Southampton, England on July 19, 1918 and then spent a few days at a rest camp
      in Cherbourg, France. Slater served with the Medical Corps, and he and his company were "on the move" from July to November
      in France and Belgium, tending to wounded soldiers, evacuating them from battlefields to hospitals, and setting up dressing
      stations. Often they came under fire from German aircraft and shelling since they had to work near the front lines. On
      November 11, 1918, an armistice was signed between the Allies and Germany, and the fighting stopped. Slater's company
      remained in France until April 1919, when they were able to sail back to America. From New York, Slater and other returning
      soldiers traveled by rail to California. On May 9, 1919, they received a heroes' welcome in San Francisco. Slater's military
      service ended May 23, 1919.</p>
      <p>After Slater returned from the war, he raised sheep, hogs, and feed in Woodland, California, where he and his friend
      Robert (Bob) Lockhart managed a section of the Conaway Ranch. Still an outstanding athlete, Slater played and coached for the
      Woodland, Yolo Post No. 77, American Legion's football and basketball teams. Slater led Woodland's American Legion football
      team to the Northern California Championship in 1927.</p>
      <p>Due to the soaring popularity of American football, rugby had virtually disappeared from the United States except in
      California. In 1920 when the Olympic Games Committee allowed the formation of a United States Olympic Rugby Team, it was no
      surprise that every team member was a Californian. Slater was one of the first players chosen for the team. The 1920 Olympic
      Games were held in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was the only team that dared to challenge the powerful
      French team, and the French eventually condescended to play the inexperienced Americans. On September 5, 1920, the Americans
      won gold medals by unexpectedly beating the French, 8-0.</p>
      <p>In 1924, the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was again made up of Californians. Babe Slater was chosen as team captain. His
      brother Norman was also on the team. At the 1924 Paris Olympic Games, only three teams entered the rugby competition: France,
      Romania, and the United States. Although the Americans had been well received in London, where they had played three
      exhibition games against English rugby teams, the French public was hostile toward the U.S. team. The French rugby team,
      regarded as the most skilled in the world, easily beat the Romanians, 61-3 on May 4, 1924. On May 11th, the United States
      defeated Romania 37-0. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was mainly made up of basketball and American football players who did not
      have much experience playing rugby, yet their size, fitness, and athletic ability made them formidable opponents. On May 18,
      1924, the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team won gold medals by defeating France 17-3 at Colombes Stadium. Angry French fans rioted in
      the stands, assaulted American supporters, and jeered the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team during the medal ceremony. After the
      American victory, the French government apologized for the behavior of the French fans. Due in part to the fans' violence,
      rugby was not included in future Olympic games.</p>
      <p>Circa 1927, Babe Slater moved from Woodland to Clarksburg, California and bought rich farming land located in the Holland
      Land Company subdivision. Slater farmed there for close to thirty years raising crops including: alfalfa, asparagus, barley,
      beet and carrot seeds, dry beans, peas, safflower, sugar beets, tomatoes, and wheat. Norman Slater left his job as a mechanic
      for Associated Oil Company in San Francisco and moved his family to Clarksburg so that he could farm with his brother. Babe
      Slater married Virginia Cave (1909-1991) in 1932, and they had one daughter, Marilyn. In 1955, Marilyn graduated from the
      University of California, Davis. She married Richard McCapes in August 1955. Soon after his daughter married, Slater retired
      from farming.</p>
      <p>Slater was active in many University of California, Davis organizations including the Cal Aggie Alumni Association,
      Friends of the Davis Campus, the UC Davis Alumni Agricultural Advisory Committee, the UC Davis Alumni Scholarship Foundation,
      and the secret society Sword and Sandals. He and Mrs. Slater were often honored guests for Picnic Day at UC Davis. Slater was
      a Picnic Day parade judge in 1956. In 1956 and 1957, he arranged for reunions of the classes of 1916 and 1917 to be held on
      the UC Davis campus during Picnic Day.</p>
      <p>Also active in the local community, Slater was a member of the Woodland, Yolo Post No. 77, American Legion and the
      Woodland Elks Lodge, No. 1299. He was elected president of the Yolo County Farm Bureau in 1951 and 1952, and, over the years,
      he and Mrs. Slater went on many Farm Bureau trips including travel to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan, and
      Mexico.</p>
      <p>Colby E. Babe Slater died on January 30, 1965. Later that year, the Calpha agricultural fraternity established the Colby
      E. "Babe" Slater Memorial Athletic Award at the University of California, Davis. This annual award and the "Babe" Slater
      Perpetual Athletic Trophy went each spring to the Davis student selected as Athlete of the Year. In addition, Slater was
      posthumously inducted into the Woodland Athletic Hall of Fame (1973) and the Cal Aggies Athletic Hall of Fame (1980) at the
      University of California, Davis.</p>

            <event>Due to the popularity of American football, rugby had almost disappeared from the United States except for
            California. The Olympic Games Committee granted Californians permission to form the United States Olympic Rugby Team
            for the upcoming Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium.</event>
            <event>Slater was one of the first players chosen for the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team. The team was mainly made up of
            students from California universities as well as recently graduated club players. Dan Carroll, an Australian gold
            medalist of the 1908 games and naturalized U.S. citizen, was both player and coach for the team.</event>
            <event>April-September. The Seventh Olympic Games were held in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. and France entered the rugby
            competition. As European champions, the French believed themselves to be far superior to the inexperienced U.S. team
            and only reluctantly consented to play the Americans.</event>
            <event>June 30. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team sailed from New York on an overcrowded Army transport ship, the

            <event>July-September. In Antwerp, the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was housed in a converted school. Meals were served at
            their quarters, and buses transported the athletes to and from practice and competition.</event>
            <event>Sept. 5. The rugby match between France and the U.S. was played at Antwerp Stadium. Unexpectedly, the United
            States beat France 8-0. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team won the gold medal. Slater became the first University of
            California, Davis alumnus to win an Olympic gold medal.</event>
            <event>Sept. 19-Oct. 10. The loss to the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team stunned the French government. They asked the American
            team to tour France and play French all-star teams. The Americans won three out of the four matches they
            played.</event>

            the fact that rugby had not been played competitively in the United States for almost a decade. The Committee did not
            provide travel funds, so players had to use their own money to get to Paris.</event>

            <event>March. The

            friendship and token of the community's appreciation of the modest all-around sportsman. The Friendship Fund allowed a
            maximum donation of fifty cents. Slater was so popular that 510 people (including 130 grammar school boys) contributed
            to the fund, which was used to buy Slater a gold watch and chain, an elk's tooth charm, and a gold card and receipt
            case.</event>
            <event>Circa March. Woodland's Yolo Post No. 77, American Legion presented Slater with a suitcase engraved with his

            in London against British rugby clubs in order to "get in shape" before the Paris Olympic Games.</event>
            <event>April. In England, the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was joined by Allen C. Valentine. Valentine, a Rhodes Scholar and
            All-American, was the only member of the team who was not from California.</event>
            <event>Circa April 27. The British Olympic Association gave a dinner for the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team at the Piccadilly
            Hotel in London.</event>
            <event>Circa April 28. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team arrived in Paris. The team was made up of superb athletes including
            California football and basketball All-Americans. Many had never played rugby, but Coach Austin relied on his team's
            size, speed, stamina, and raw athletic ability to compensate for its technical deficiencies.</event>
            <event>Circa April-May. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was the target of French hostility. After immigration officials
            mistakenly refused the team entry into France and the American players forced their way off ship and onto dry land, the
            French press labeled the team, "street fighters and saloon brawlers." When American rugby team members ventured outside
            their Paris hotel, they were insulted and even spat upon by the French.</event>
            <event>Circa May. Cash and other possessions were stolen from the U.S. Olympic Team's dressing room while they were at
            practice.</event>
            <event>May. Three teams entered the Olympic rugby competition in Paris: France, the United States, and Romania.</event>
            <event>May 4. France won their rugby match against Romania, 61-3.</event>
            <event>May 11. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team defeated Romania 37-0. The French crowd booed every American score, but both
            the American and French press noted the lack of violence and skilled nature of American play, along with the Americans'
            size and fitness.</event>
            <event>May 18. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team won the gold medal by defeating France 17-3 at Colombes Stadium, which was
            filled with 50,000 spectators. The French rugby team was expected to easily beat the inexperienced American team.
            During the game, the French were devastated by American football-style tackling. The hits were within the rules of the
            game. The humiliating defeat of the French team angered their fans, who rioted in the stands and assaulted American
            supporters. The French fans threw bottles and rocks at the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team and tried to break through the tall
            wire fence that surrounded the playing field. Tens of thousand of hostile onlookers jeered the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team
            during the medal ceremony, the raising of the American flag, and the playing of the "Star Spangled Banner". After the
            ceremony, the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team was rescued from the rioting crowd by dozens of gendarmes. Due in part to the bad
            behavior of the French crowd and the lack of international participation in Olympic rugby matches, rugby was not
            included in future Olympic games. The French government later apologized for the behavior of the French fans, and soon
            after, the French press began to portray the U.S. Olympic Rugby Team as heroes.</event>
            <event>May 18. A banquet was given by the French Rugby Federation at Palais D'Orsay in honor of the Olympic Rugby
            Games. The U.S. Olympic Rugby Team attended this official banquet. The Prince of Wales was also a guest.</event>

            honor of the team's Olympic victory. The banquet was held at the Inter-Allied Club of Paris. Many prominent
            Californians attended. Senator Phelan presented the team with medals and a statue that symbolized victory.</event>
            <event>May 21. Coach Austin and eight players left Paris for Cherbourg on the first leg of their journey home. They

          <p>Arranged chronologically. The 1924 letters relate to the Paris Olympic Games. The 1948 letter has to do with Slater's
          choice of farming as his life's work. The 1956 and 1957 letters and class rosters pertain to Slater's efforts to organize
          Picnic Day class reunions for the University of California, Davis' classes of 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917. The 1973 letter
          has to do with Slater's posthumous induction into the Woodland (Calif.) Athletic Hall of Fame.</p>

            <p>Arranged by subject. Contains many photographs of Babe Slater. The Berkeley (Calif.) High School Rugby Team prints
            include a group portrait and three action shots. Most of the University of California, Davis prints are of Picnic Day
            1916. The World War I prints are snapshots of soldiers. The Seventh Olympic Games prints are formal shots of the United
            States Olympic Rugby Team and images from a rugby match between the Americans and the French Sud-Ouest Team at
            Bordeaux. Prints from the Eighth Olympic Games range from formal shots of the United States Olympic Rugby Team to
            snapshots of team members aboard ship. See also the Scrapbook series for more prints from the Eighth Olympic Games.
            Images of Slater, family, and friends from childhood through the later years make up the Family and Friends prints.
            Unidentified prints are snapshots of bridges, buildings, cattle, sporting events, and ships.</p>

          <p>This scrapbook was compiled by Babe Slater's mother, Louise. It contains newspaper clippings, photographs, and
          ephemera related to Slater winning an Olympic gold medal as captain of the United States Olympic Rugby Team during the
          1924 Paris Olympic Games. When the collection was processed, items were removed from the scrapbook and placed in
          acid-free folders. The scrapbook pages were scanned before they were disassembled in order to keep a record of the
          original positions of items on the pages. Preservation photocopies of newspaper clippings were also made.</p>
